## 2025-02-17: Acquire Data Milestone

### Data Wrangling
This week, we acquired dining data, including multiple Excel sheets, which we processed into separate CSV files for easier manipulation. We have started adding files to the clean folder to make it ready for visualizations and basic explanatory analysis for next week. We combined data from different semesters while ensuring consistent formatting across all files. Additionally, we gathered meal plan pricing information and scraped Reddit for reviews of various dining locations to supplement our analysis. Currently, we are refining the datasets to facilitate seamless integration by rows and columns. Our primary challenge is standardizing the structure of disparate data sources to enable efficient merging and analysis. We are continuously acquiring new data while parallelly processing the existing data into usable formats.

### Technology Plan
Our team has decided to use RStudio and Github as our main software of choice. The reason behind using RStudio is that it has compatibility with R and Python, allowing for some flexibility amongst the group depending on what we are most comfortable using at a given point throughout the project. The plan with these is that we have already cloned our team repository into Rstudio so we each have access to all of the repository files and from there we can create and push changes directly to Github as we progress through the project. Finally, we believe that Rshiny will be our choice for creating the dashboard as most of us are pretty proficient in R overall. While as a group we have little experience with Rshiny, we figure it is something useful to learn for the project and beyond.

### Project Goals
Statistical Superstars' goals for this project are to explore ISU Dining meal plans, prices, and dining hall reviews to analyze the success and return rates of the dining halls. Specifically, we would like to calculate the percentage of students who repurchase meal plans and uncover findings on which student living locations are most likely to purchase and repurchase a meal plan. Additionally, we want to look at how much income ISU Dining brings from meal plans, intending to predict how much income they will receive. Our audience is Iowa State dining.

### Team Evaluation
Our team, the Statistical Superstars, are currently in line with regard to the given timeline. The largest obstacle we have faced was in the data gathering section of last week. Since the team was interested in utilizing private data from the Iowa State University department of dining, we had to wait outside of our time frame for responses giving the "OK" along with the individuals at the department of dining to prep the data for our use cases. The obstacle of having the data publicly available on our github could also cause some issues given that we were instructed to ideally have everything available within the github. Our team discussed this potential issue and we came up with the solution that we would hold the data privately and run our scripts locally to do analysis/modeling. Another primary obstacle for meeting the weekly and end-of-semester goals would be biting off more than we can chew with our planning(since it is currently pretty dynamic because of the tentative data sources). A solution for this issue is to consistently talk about progress at every meeting during class to ensure we all are on track and on the same page. Additionally, we are taking extra steps to avoid this obstacle by providing updates in our groupchat whenever a task is completed/started.
