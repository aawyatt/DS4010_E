## 2025-02-02: Team Formation

Team Name: Statistical Superstars   
The team name came from a name generator as the team was struggling to come up with a name we felt was creative yet relatable. We knew we wanted the name to deal with something related to statistics and after going though some of the options presented to us by the generator, the group really like the name Statistical Superstars. Thus was the group name going forward.

GitHub Link: https://github.com/aawyatt/DS4010_E  

Summary of Project Idea Discussion (one paragraph): 
The team talked about working on a project relating to ISU Dining, depending on the data that we could gain access to. The team has already reached out to ISU Dining to see what data we could use and is currently awaiting a response. A second project was using data from the US Census and Iowa.data.gov to create a dashboard using GIS and demographic data for the state of Iowa. Finally, the last project that the group was interested in was working with data from the USDA and agriculture patterns in Iowa. 

Summary of Tool Proficiencies/Preferences (one paragraph): 
Each member in the group knows how to use R and Python the most with a preference for working with R. The group does have some experience in using SQL as well however not in a collaborative environment. Some additional technologies were discussed, especially for the dashboard where Tableau and RShiny would require additional learning by the group but were deemed as really useful for what we want to do for the project goals. 
  
Summary of Communication Platform to be used (one paragraph):
The team has decided to use Microsoft Teams as the main source of communication. Each group member has access to Teams through Iowa State, which provides the most versatility and reliability for communicating. While a Snapchat group chat was discussed, the team felt it was unreliable due to messages deleting after a period of time. Thus resulting on the final decision of using Teams. 
  
Plan/Tasks to settle on a Project (one paragraph): 
The team has decided to return on Monday with roughly 3 to 4 data source ideas (1 per group member) to help the group decide on our project going forward. As mentioned above, we are currently waiting on responses from private sources and will hopefully have responses by the middle of next week. If not, the goal of the 3 to 4 source ideas is to be flexible in the case of certain sources falling through. 
 

## 2025-02-09: Pick Data/Project Milestone
This week, we created our GitHub environment for our project which can be visited here: https://github.com/aawyatt/DS4010_E. Additionally, we have created folders to organize our raw data for our project once we decide on our final datasets, but we are currently waiting to hear back from ISU Dining be fore that can happen. The README.md file will outline the description of what we intend to do with our project and will be regularly updated as the project progresses. Along with the additions of new folders and definitions of key terms.

## 2025-02-16: Acquire Data Milestone

### Data Wrangling
This week, we acquired dining data, including multiple Excel sheets, which we processed into separate CSV files for easier manipulation. We have started adding files to the clean folder to make it ready for visualizations and basic explanatory analysis for next week. We combined data from different semesters while ensuring consistent formatting across all files. Additionally, we gathered meal plan pricing information and scraped Reddit for reviews of various dining locations to supplement our analysis. Currently, we are refining the datasets to facilitate seamless integration by rows and columns. Our primary challenge is standardizing the structure of disparate data sources to enable efficient merging and analysis. We are continuously acquiring new data while parallelly processing the existing data into usable formats.

### Technology Plan
Our team has decided to use RStudio and Github as our main software of choice. The reason behind using RStudio is that it has compatibility with R and Python, allowing for some flexibility amongst the group depending on what we are most comfortable using at a given point throughout the project. The plan with these is that we have already cloned our team repository into Rstudio so we each have access to all of the repository files and from there we can create and push changes directly to Github as we progress through the project. Finally, we believe that Rshiny will be our choice for creating the dashboard as most of us are pretty proficient in R overall. While as a group we have little experience with Rshiny, we figure it is something useful to learn for the project and beyond.

### Project Goals
Statistical Superstars' goals for this project are to explore ISU Dining meal plans, prices, and dining hall reviews to analyze the success and return rates of the dining halls. Specifically, we would like to calculate the percentage of students who repurchase meal plans and uncover findings on which student living locations are most likely to purchase and repurchase a meal plan. Additionally, we want to look at how much income ISU Dining brings from meal plans, intending to predict how much income they will receive. Our audience is Iowa State dining.

### Team Evaluation
Our team, the Statistical Superstars, are currently in line with regard to the given timeline. The largest obstacle we have faced was in the data gathering section of last week. Since the team was interested in utilizing private data from the Iowa State University department of dining, we had to wait outside of our time frame for responses giving the "OK" along with the individuals at the department of dining to prep the data for our use cases. The obstacle of having the data publicly available on our github could also cause some issues given that we were instructed to ideally have everything available within the github. Our team discussed this potential issue and we came up with the solution that we would hold the data privately and run our scripts locally to do analysis/modeling. Another primary obstacle for meeting the weekly and end-of-semester goals would be biting off more than we can chew with our planning(since it is currently pretty dynamic because of the tentative data sources). A solution for this issue is to consistently talk about progress at every meeting during class to ensure we all are on track and on the same page. Additionally, we are taking extra steps to avoid this obstacle by providing updates in our groupchat whenever a task is completed/started.


## 2025-02-23: Project Goals Milestone

### Exploratory Analysis
For our exploratory analysis, since our project is in R our group has decided to use the dplyr, tidyr, shiny, and ggplot2/plotly libraries.  Dplyr and tidyr are used for our data cleaning and manipulation while shiny and ggplot2/plotly are being used to create our initial visualizations and eventual dashboards each depending on whether the group wants them to be interactive or not. During our preliminary analysis, the team identified three very important predictors for our eventual model of predicting dining income being price of meal plans, the number of students enrolled, and the type of meal plans themselves. Within each of these predictors, we identified two outlying meal plans that will be disregarded in the model which were RA meal plans that are provided for free by ISU Dining to the RAs of each residence hall. No major issues have arisen during this process so far as the majority has been making simple visualizations and joining/cleaning the data into the team’s needed format before model building begins next week.

### Project Progress
Our team has been working on the initial explanatory phase this week. We have collected all the data we need for now and have started transforming the data to easily bindable formats and standardized the naming conventions to be consistent among the datasets. We have also started our initial explanatory graphs and tables to understand the distribution of the various variables(meal plan and housing location). We have also scrapped some data from Reddit about reviews for various dining halls. We conducted an online Snapchat survey to get the personal preference ranking for the dining halls. All the team members have got the data in their local r studio and connected to the GitHub repo. We have also started testing and creating some dashboard models in R shiny to get some hands-on practice. As a team, we have found an effective way of allocating tasks and ensuring they are done on time by communicating through our Teams channel with updates. We have also decided on some research questions of interest to us. We have decided to move forward to the modeling phase next week, so we are planning to get suggestions from each member for the models they are suggesting and evaluate their efficiency.

### Modeling Plan 
Statistical Superstars is interested in fitting a multiple linear regression model to predict future meal plan pricing, with the potential explanatory variables of meal plan type, the number of students who purchase each plan, students' living situations, and the price as the response variable. We also want to predict the number of students who purchase each meal plan type. This will be achieved by fitting a Poisson regression model to predict future meal plan purchases, with the meal plan type as the explanatory variable and the amount of each meal plan purchased as the response variable. Poisson is used because the response variable is a count, and our data meets the assumption that each student is independent. Additionally, we would like to look into predicting if students will repurchase a meal plan. We currently do not have a concrete idea of what model would be ideal. These models fit well into our current dashboarding plan because we can show visualizations and summary statistics of our variables of interest and tie in what the future may look like with meal plan prices and the number of students who purchase each one. 

### Project Goals - Jonah

Our team, the Satistical Superstars, is coming to a close with data acquisition and cleaning and is shifting our views to modeling, exploratory analysis, and visualization via a dashboard. The primary research question that our team is trying to answer is: "What is the general popularity of the dining centers of Iowa State University?". This is with the hope of presenting our useful findings via an online dashboard to not only our fellow classmates but also to the Department of Dining and other administration at Iowa State University. Additionally, our research is done with the intention of identifying any issues that could be changed with the current dining system to improve the lives of all individuals at Iowa State. One of these issues that we are planning on diving into is the churn rate of various dining plans. Identifying any trends with churn could allow for the Department of Dining to really dial in on their area to maximize student engagement with dining halls. This kind of research would be what we want to portray in our dashboard, "Do individuals with a particular dining plan have a higher churn rate?" "Do people residing in a specific residence building have a higher churn rate?" "Are there ever any cases where instead of churning, the individual downgrades or upgrades their plan over the semesters?". Over the course of the semester, our team is planning on looking into churn, meal plan pricing predictions, how ratings of the dining halls have changed over time, and more.


## 2025-3-02: Exploratory Analysis Milestone

### Brainstorm Dashboard
Statistical Superstars are currently in the process of developing our preliminary plans for the final dashboard. Last week, our team created a preliminary dashboard to "test the waters" with R Shiny because our group doesn't have much experience with the package. This preliminary dashboard was similar to the example demonstrated in class, however, it was catered to the features of our group's dataset. Our team plans to visualize our four primary models via a dashboard. Those are predicting churn, the income of ISU dining, the population of residence halls, and the type of meal plan purchased. One idea that has been brought up and might be explored further is to give the option to switch the model type in each prediction section. The reasoning behind that our professor mentioned that a core motive of the course is to demonstrate everything the undergraduate data science students learn throughout their time at Iowa State University and showcase it. Creating more models for this data could showcase our modeling capabilities and give new data science students (or even people thinking about joining the data science program) to see what these models are capable of in a "real life" scenerio. This also allows these newer students to see how different models interact with our data, which could potentially compliment their introductory classes with understanding the reasoning behind choosing a new model. 


### Data Report
As a group, our current data is sufficient to answer the questions we want to answer. We currently want to answer the questions of whether we can predict the churn rate of meal plans of students on campus, as well as predict the income from meal plans for the university. To achieve this, we have joined together the data of the population of residence halls as well as the meal plans of students on campus spanning the last four years. Additionally, we will use this data to create a Markov model to help predict the probability of transitioning from different meal plans between academic years to depict churn rate. We haven’t needed to add anything to our datasets now, however, we have had to modify the datasets to allow a single student to hold multiple meal plans in a single semester, as there were many occurrences of this. Some assumptions about our data have had to be made, the first is that when a student doesn’t have a meal plan during a semester and doesn’t have a record on their living location, we are assuming they are no longer on campus and disregarding them from our Markov calculations for our model. Finally, we are dropping RA and CA plans from the dataset as they are unique to the RAs of living spaces, which is a very small portion of our data.


### Project Progress
This week, Statistical Superstars continued to explore our data by receiving new tables from ISU Residence Halls and transforming/cleaning data. Jonah contacted ISU Residence this week and made a new dataset from the information he received from them. Srika and Cael made helpful plots and visualizations to assist us in narrowing down our interests for what to include in our final dashboard. Alison created two new datasets from our existing dining data by pivoting them to create a row for each ID and their corresponding meal plans/living situations. Our team is very strong at communicating, and we've come up with many great ideas for what to include in our dashboard and how to model our data. Moving forward, we need to decide what models to build and what transformations we need to do to our data to achieve those models. Each team member will contribute by researching the models we decide on (potentially Markov and Poisson) and implementing the initial code.


### Exploratory Analysis

We explored most of the data we gathered.  We made plot and summary tables. We looked at how some new meal plan prices relate to the prices of similar meals that existed earlier. We also decided to use the residence hall and price and previous plans a student took to predict the meal plan. We also wanted to model the meal plan prices. We have made plots looking at meal plan price trends for all the semesters. We also dropped meal plans that were discontinued. We also decided to drop the RA plans because our goal is to predict the expected income, and RA plans usually do not contribute to the income. We also looked proportion of people in different meal plans by housing distribution and found some plans were more popular in apartment-style housing. In contrast, others were more popular in dorms. We have decided to keep some of these visualizations we are just deciding on how to make to more interactive to user input. We also have joined the Google ratings data with the survey we conducted online about people’s preferences for the various dining centers. In the dataset we had for churn rate, we do have a lot of NAs for which we are still thinking about which assumptions would be the most appropriate.

## 2025-3-09: Brainstorm Dashboard Milestone

### Finalize Data Models

We are planning on using three types of models for our data. The first is a Poisson model used to predict how many students will purchase each type of meal plan in the Fall 2025 semester. It will use the previous meal plan counts by semester as the response variable, a discrete numeric variable. The explanatory variables we hope to use are term (semester), meal plan type, and price of the meal plans. The preliminary model with those three variables had a large difference between the residual deviance and its degrees of freedom, indicating some potential overdispersion. A model with interaction terms or a linear model may need to be used to remedy this. Our second model is a Markov model. We are using this model to determine the probability of a student going from one meal plan to another and what type of plans they are most likely to switch to. We are using a dataset with one row for each student and a column for each term we have in our data (Fall 2021-Spring 2025) containing the meal plan for each student for the respective semester. None of our group members have used Markov models before, so we are making sure we're familiar with the assumptions and goals of a Markov model. Our final model will be a linear model predicting future prices for each meal plan. The response variable is the price and the explanatory variables are the term, meal plan type, and potentially an inflation factor. We want to combine this model with the predicted counts of each meal plan to estimate the income ISU Dining will receive in Fall 2025. 

### Brainstorm Dashboard

This week we clearly outlined the tabs and their intended contents. We also refined our base dashboard and are working to improve it alongside our parallel model training. Our goal is to create a highly flexible dashboard that allows users to filter data by semester, meal plan, and housing location, among other options. In addition to default visualizations, we plan to offer a “build your own plots” feature for custom exploration. We are experimenting with various themes and layouts using Bootstrap themes and Shiny widgets. While we have not encountered any major implementation issues, we are still in the process of fully integrating the layout with our code. Currently, we envision the dashboard as a tool for showcasing dining data visualizations, predicting meal plan trends, and calculating churn rates, using nearly all of the collected data for graphs and models. The only data not directly included will be the ratings and comments we scraped, which we intend to use to provide context on user behavior rather than display on the dashboard.


### Data Dictionary

For our mini-milestone, we chose to have it based on a data dictionary. The primary idea for this milestone stemmed from a previous dataset we analyzed during one of the initial weeks. Although this dataset wasn't selected, the organization of this project stuck out to us. Eventually, it made its way back to our project in the form of an outline for the organization. The dataset for the project was somewhat dense for our team since it was primarily created for other people within the same agricultural field; however, when trying to digest the dataset and understand what it was trying to illustrate, our team heavily utilized their easy-to-interpret data dictionary. Carrying this to the context of our dataset, some people/students looking at it will not have the time to understand how each data point was derived or even what each data point means. The solution we came up with was to implement a dictionary that would explain all of the points and a general overview of the interworkings of our models. This will provide a solid foundation for anyone interested in our project(potentially people building off it in future semesters).

### Project Progress

For the Statistical Superstars, we have been communicating very well and as a group feel like the project is coming along very nicely. This week, we feel we achieved the goals we had set out for ourselves and the class, as we have decided on the final models we want to pursue with Cael and Alison starting development of each of those models. These models relate to predicting churn rate, price, and number of plans for ISU Dining in the future. Additionally, we have also decided on our final layout for our dashboard where Jonah and Srika have started development. The biggest roadblocks that we have encountered have come with the model development as the Poisson model we are developing has issues taking in the current data so we need to modify the data in numeric types to make in easier as well and change zeros to Nas so the data that should be discarded is done so accordingly. Overall, the group has progressed very well and as for final steps going forward, we plan to finish model development within the next 1-2 weeks as well as have an initial outline for our dashboard developed in Rshiny.

## 2025-03-16: Finalize Data Models

### Finalize Data Models
We will be incorporating at least two models in our dashboard. The first is to predict the number of students who will purchase each type of meal plan for the fall 2025 semester. A simple linear model is used, with Term, MealPlan, Price, and Term*MealPlan as explanatory variables. This model assumes normality of the errors, independent observations, and equal variance. The fitted vs residual plot shows grouping with differing variances within and across groups. This violates an assumption. We're looking into utilizing random forests or doing a model for each meal plan. If neither works well, we will continue with the linear model and explain it in the discussion. Our second model is a Markov model used to calculate the probability of going from one meal plan to another. The explanatory variable is the proportions calculated for each pair of meal plans (e.g., going from Cardinal to Gold, NA to Gold, etc.). The output would be similar: the probability of going to another or no meal plan, given a certain starting meal plan. The Markov model assumes that a future meal plan depends only on the current meal plan (or lack thereof), and not the past meal plans.

### Project Progress
The Statistical Superstars have made significant progress on their project, with each team member contributing to data acquisition, cleaning, visualization, and modeling. All team members have their tech stack set up on their local machines, using RStudio and GitHub for version control and collaboration. The next steps involve finalizing the predictive models (Poisson, Markov, and linear regression) and fully integrating them into the RShiny dashboard. The team communicates effectively through meetings and a group chat, ensuring alignment on progress and challenges. Each member has a clear plan moving forward, focusing on refining models and dashboard development. The primary roadblocks include overdispersion issues in the Poisson model and data format adjustments for modeling. These challenges are being addressed through data modifications and potential model adjustments.

### Dashboard Sketch
We designed the dashboard for the dining department to see the analysis of the precious data. We also created models that could help them simulate different scenarios to help them decide pricing. We are trying to keep it accessible for people with non-satistical backgrounds, too. We outlined the dashboard on paper, and we successfully implemented that design in Shiny. For now, we have the tabs and subtabs we want and a basic outline for the other elements inside each tab. We currently have 4 tabs: overview, Explanatory Analysis (Sub tabs : housing and meal plan), predictive analysis (sub-tab: churn rate, income prediction), and conclusion tab. For integration, we have implemented "build your own plot" and "build your own model" features, which help users create visuals and models with their desired variables/filters. The dashboard is fully functional for the explanatory analysis, and we are working on integrating the models. We are still deciding on the final tables and visuals to include, but we have a basic idea of what we want for now. For now, the dashboard design has been smooth. We are working on the models and integrating them into the dashboard next. We have also decided to use the ISU color palette for the dashboard to make it more visually appealing and appropriate without a theme.

### Overview Tab:
This tab gives a high-level overview and some numerical summaries of the selected data. We have added a purpose paragraph and the data dictionary with what each variable and type is. We currently have a data preview that shows a snapshot of the underlying data. We also have some basic summary visualizations of counts and meal plan distribution for all the data from selected semesters. All of the plots in the dashboard are interactive plotly plots that dynamically change with the data selected. We are planning to add the assumptions we made about the data into this tab.

### Explanatory Analysis Tab: 

**Meal Plans:** This tab does a deep dive into the inner workings and relationships of the meal plans here at Iowa State University. This tab consists of 3 subtabs: Distribution, Trends over time, and Price Analysis. Distribution gives the overall popularity of each meal plan, this is done through the “percentage of students” x-axis. Additionally, the user is able to select the time range of the data by term as well as the meal plans that they want to compare. The trends over time subtab gives more of a high-level overview of the trends of each specified meal plan so the user is able to see which plans are increasing, decreasing, or exhibiting some other behavior. Finally, the price analysis subtab provides more of an outline of historical income for the university. This is done by graphing each plan by its cost and how many students opted in for the specified plans. Similar to the other 2 subtabs, the user is able to specify the time range and the meal plan types for more interactivity. Below these subtabs, there are graphs illustrating the top 5 meal plans by term and the meal plan price trends over time. The first being very similar to the Distribution subtab, however, the key difference is that it shows the distribution of plans for every term to potentially give the user some more historical insight on the plans. The second graph “Meal Plan Price Trends” illustrates the inflation of price on each meal plan over the years so the user could be able to distinguish the increase of price by each meal plan and visualize the variation of rates. The whole tab is then wrapped up by an example of the dataset utilized to create the graphs to give the user a bit of a visual of the backend side of this project. Overall, if the goal of this tab is completed, the user will leave the tab having a much better understanding of the current historical trends of the Iowa State University dining data.


**Housing:** This tab allows a more detailed analysis of the housing distribution of the students and its association with the meal plan choices. We have local filters to terms and specific housing locations interested. We also have an option to look at the data as plain numbers or as percentages relative to the total. We have three subtabs: Distribution by location, Meal plan by location, and Trends over time. The Distribution by location is the distribution of the total number of students across all selected semesters in selected housing locations. Meal plan by location: This plot shows the percentage of each meal plan within that housing location. Trends over time: The change in the distribution of the number of students in each meal plan over the semesters. We have a plot that shows the top housing locations over the selected semesters. Optional Meal Plan Adoption Rate: this plot plans to give a plot showing how much of the meal plan is not required housing locations have meal plans. Detailed Housing Data: A snapshot of the data structure used for the tab.

### Model Updates - ‘Predictive Models’ Tab

**Churn Analysis:** The Markov model will be implemented into the dashboard under the “Churn Analysis” section under “Predictive Models”. Within this tab, users will be able to choose a starting meal plan and based on the starting point the Markov model will perform a simulation over 4 years showing how a student may proceed in choosing their meal plans based on the probabilities used to train the model based on our current data. Additionally, the dashboard will also display a visual graph of the simulation results in a time-series graph allowing for easier user understanding.

**Meal Plan Prediction:** A Poisson model is being built to predict the number of students who will purchase a given meal plan for a given term (e.g., Fall 2025). Users will be able to select the term of interest as well as the meal plans they want predictions for. Users, more specifically ISU Dining, will also be able to incorporate our predictive pricing model to get the estimated income based on the term and the selected meal plans. Once our models are finalized, we’ll update the dashboard page to better reflect the models.

### Conclusion:
This tab gives overall trend observations and conclusions based on the results of the models and our exploratory analysis.  

## 2025-04-6: Minimum Viable Dashboard

Link to Dashboard: https://ds4010groupe.shinyapps.io/shiny/
For our dashboard, we have already inserted our exploratory data into our dashboard and have allowed for user customization where a user can choose different periods and meal plans while the dashboard will adjust the graphs accordingly. In addition to this, we are currently in the process of integrating our Markov, Poisson, and linear price prediction models into the dashboard. The plan for these is that users will have the ability to have some input into the models, whether it is a starting meal plan, time period, or meal plan type, and then the dashboard will output the results of the models as well as some diagnostics for people who may be more advanced in data science. Finally, we have been discussing the idea of implementing an LLM into the dashboard that could take a graph and output a simplified summary of what the plot is depicting and what the diagnostics are telling us about the model. This will allow for more novice users to gain a better understanding of the results as well as how the model works but will be implemented in the final dashboard if time allows for us to complete it.

## 2025-04-13: Add Models to Dashboard

Instructions to Run: 
Clone the GitHub repository at https://github.com/aawyatt/DS4010_E 
Once cloned, in R run the app.R file to gain access to the Shiny Dashboard.
Once in the dashboard, models have been implemented under the “Predictive Models” Tab.
Link to Dashboard: https://ds4010groupe.shinyapps.io/shiny/ 

In our dashboard, we have fully integrated our Markov and price prediction models with our Poisson model, which is almost fully implemented with some final adjustments to the visuals of the model’s output needing to be made. For the Markov Model, the purpose is to be able to simulate the transitions of meal plans for a student in 4 years. The explanatory variables for this model are the transition probabilities of going from one meal plan to the next based on the transition period from Spring 2024 to Fall 2024. The model then takes these probabilities as a matrix to output steady-state probabilities for each meal plan depicting the probability of which meal plan a student will have in the long run. Additionally, based on these probabilities, the model can perform a simulation from a user-inputted starting meal plan over 4 years to tell which meal plan (if any) a student may use. Each simulation will be different unless a seed is set which the user has the option to do if they wish.

The meal plan price prediction model’s purpose is to predict the future price of meal plans. It is a simple linear model predicting future prices based on past prices for the selected meal plan. It uses the previous prices as the only explanatory variable for each of the meal plans. The response variable is the yearly price for a particular meal plan in a future term. It also lets the user optionally input the inflation factor (inflation with respect to 2024/last year in the dataset used for modeling) to account for inflation, but otherwise, it also predicts fairly accurately without the inflation factor considering the amount of data we have(only the past 4 years). If there is no inflation the model by default takes there was no inflation since 2024. 

The Poisson model’s purpose is to predict the amount of each meal plan purchased in a term. The explanatory variables are the Meal Plan (Campanile, Cardinal, Gold, Meal Blocks), Semester (Spring, Fall), Year, and the number of undergraduate students (from Iowa Regents data). The response variable is the number of meal plans purchased. Users can select each of the explanatory variables that they want to fit into the model. The default values for the inputs will be all meal plan types, the upcoming semester/year (in this case, Fall 2025), and the previous year’s undergrad student count. Users can change any of these values to fit their interests or use cases. For example, ISU Dining could input the Fall 2025 number of undergraduate students if they have that information before the public does. 

## 2025-04-20: Dashboard Peer Review

For the current status of implementing contextual information into our dashboard, our group has decided to do the following. We have created a box in our “Overview” tab to lay out the purpose/ goal of our dashboard to the user. With it being on the opening tab, this will make it very prevalent to someone seeing the dashboard for the first time before exploring the rest of the dashboard. This box also contains the intended audience of our dashboard and briefly explains how it would be beneficial to them. Finally, we have provided definitions for each of our models as well as key terms such as “churn rate” in their specific tabs in the dashboard. This was to help avoid users having to continuously flip through tabs to see definitions and the model’s output. Finally, we have included a “Conclusions” tab to help display to the user some of the findings we found during our analysis. This was to make it easier for our target audience to understand these findings and help them potentially pursue further, more in-depth analysis into these areas, as they have access to a larger scale of data than what we were given.

## 2025-04-27: Finalize Dashboard

For this week, the team has been working completing the final touches to our dashboard as well as waiting on what feedback we get from our peers to see what we can fix going forward. Prior to the feedback, the group has worked on trying to fix some of the labels of the visuals as they don't align with what the current state of the dashboard contains. Additionally, we have worked to fill in the conclusions tab based on the results of our models as that was the final piece we were missing to have a fully complete dashboard. After receiving the peer feedback, the group has decided to make the following changes to the dashboard prior to the final presentation. We are going to remove our descriptions of the data itself as well as the data preview from our overview tab as many reviews said it made the dashboard feel too much like a PowerPoint and users would feel uninterested in that information. Additionally, we are going to fix our color scheme to be more consistent throughout the dashboard to make it more visual appealing. Finally, we are going to shift the plots in our Exploratory Analysis tab for the meal plans so each plot can have its own line in addition to removing the data description sections to help ensure our labels won't cross over or get cutoff like they are now so the dashboard appears more professional. Finally, Jonah will implement the chat bot into our dashboard as he was able to find a simple yet effective way to do so that can take in the descriptions we already have placed into the dashboard. Overall, our main priorities going forward are to fix the visualizations of our dashboard and begin laying out the plan for our written report for next week.
