## 2025-02-17: Acquire Data Milestone

### Data Wrangling
This week, we acquired dining data, including multiple Excel sheets, which we processed into separate CSV files for easier manipulation. We have started adding files to the clean folder to make it ready for visualizations and basic explanatory analysis for next week. We combined data from different semesters while ensuring consistent formatting across all files. Additionally, we gathered meal plan pricing information and scraped Reddit for reviews of various dining locations to supplement our analysis. Currently, we are refining the datasets to facilitate seamless integration by rows and columns. Our primary challenge is standardizing the structure of disparate data sources to enable efficient merging and analysis. We are continuously acquiring new data while parallelly processing the existing data into usable formats.

### Technology Plan
Our team has decided to use RStudio and Github as our main software of choice. The reason behind using RStudio is that it has compatibility with R and Python, allowing for some flexibility amongst the group depending on what we are most comfortable using at a given point throughout the project. The plan with these is that we have already cloned our team repository into Rstudio so we each have access to all of the repository files and from there we can create and push changes directly to Github as we progress through the project. Finally, we believe that Rshiny will be our choice for creating the dashboard as most of us are pretty proficient in R overall. While as a group we have little experience with Rshiny, we figure it is something useful to learn for the project and beyond.

### Project Goals
Statistical Superstars' goals for this project are to explore ISU Dining meal plans, prices, and dining hall reviews to analyze the success and return rates of the dining halls. Specifically, we would like to calculate the percentage of students who repurchase meal plans and uncover findings on which student living locations are most likely to purchase and repurchase a meal plan. Additionally, we want to look at how much income ISU Dining brings from meal plans, intending to predict how much income they will receive. Our audience is Iowa State dining.

### Team Evaluation
Our team, the Statistical Superstars, are currently in line with regard to the given timeline. The largest obstacle we have faced was in the data gathering section of last week. Since the team was interested in utilizing private data from the Iowa State University department of dining, we had to wait outside of our time frame for responses giving the "OK" along with the individuals at the department of dining to prep the data for our use cases. The obstacle of having the data publicly available on our github could also cause some issues given that we were instructed to ideally have everything available within the github. Our team discussed this potential issue and we came up with the solution that we would hold the data privately and run our scripts locally to do analysis/modeling. Another primary obstacle for meeting the weekly and end-of-semester goals would be biting off more than we can chew with our planning(since it is currently pretty dynamic because of the tentative data sources). A solution for this issue is to consistently talk about progress at every meeting during class to ensure we all are on track and on the same page. Additionally, we are taking extra steps to avoid this obstacle by providing updates in our groupchat whenever a task is completed/started.


## 2025-02-24: Project Goals Milestone

### Exploratory Analysis - Cael
For our exploratory analysis, since our project is in R our group has decided to use the dplyr, tidyr, shiny, and ggplot2/plotly libraries.  Dplyr and tidyr are used for our data cleaning and manipulation while shiny and ggplot2/plotly are being used to create our initial visualizations and eventual dashboards each depending on whether the group wants them to be interactive or not. During our preliminary analysis, the team identified three very important predictors for our eventual model of predicting dining income being price of meal plans, the number of students enrolled, and the type of meal plans themselves. Within each of these predictors, we identified two outlying meal plans that will be disregarded in the model which were RA meal plans that are provided for free by ISU Dining to the RAs of each residence hall. No major issues have arisen during this process so far as the majority has been making simple visualizations and joining/cleaning the data into the team’s needed format before model building begins next week.

### Project Progress
Our team has been working on the initial explanatory phase this week. We have collected all the data we need for now and have started transforming the data to easily bindable formats and standardized the naming conventions to be consistent among the datasets. We have also started our initial explanatory graphs and tables to understand the distribution of the various variables(meal plan and housing location). We have also scrapped some data from Reddit about reviews for various dining halls. We conducted an online Snapchat survey to get the personal preference ranking for the dining halls. All the team members have got the data in their local r studio and connected to the GitHub repo. We have also started testing and creating some dashboard models in R shiny to get some hands-on practice. As a team, we have found an effective way of allocating tasks and ensuring they are done on time by communicating through our Teams channel with updates. We have also decided on some research questions of interest to us. We have decided to move forward to the modeling phase next week, so we are planning to get suggestions from each member for the models they are suggesting and evaluate their efficiency.

### Modeling Plan - 
Statistical Superstars is interested in fitting a multiple linear regression model to predict future meal plan pricing, with the potential explanatory variables of meal plan type, the number of students who purchase each plan, students' living situations, and the price as the response variable. We also want to predict the number of students who purchase each meal plan type. This will be achieved by fitting a Poisson regression model to predict future meal plan purchases, with the meal plan type as the explanatory variable and the amount of each meal plan purchased as the response variable. Poisson is used because the response variable is a count, and our data meets the assumption that each student is independent. Additionally, we would like to look into predicting if students will repurchase a meal plan. We currently do not have a concrete idea of what model would be ideal. These models fit well into our current dashboarding plan because we can show visualizations and summary statistics of our variables of interest and tie in what the future may look like with meal plan prices and the number of students who purchase each one. 

### Project Goals - Jonah

Our team, the Satistical Superstars, is coming to a close with data acquisition and cleaning and is shifting our views to modeling, exploratory analysis, and visualization via a dashboard. The primary research question that our team is trying to answer is: "What is the general popularity of the dining centers of Iowa State University?". This is with the hope of presenting our useful findings via an online dashboard to not only our fellow classmates but also to the Department of Dining and other administration at Iowa State University. Additionally, our research is done with the intention of identifying any issues that could be changed with the current dining system to improve the lives of all individuals at Iowa State. One of these issues that we are planning on diving into is the churn rate of various dining plans. Identifying any trends with churn could allow for the Department of Dining to really dial in on their area to maximize student engagement with dining halls. This kind of research would be what we want to portray in our dashboard, "Do individuals with a particular dining plan have a higher churn rate?" "Do people residing in a specific residence building have a higher churn rate?" "Are there ever any cases where instead of churning, the individual downgrades or upgrades their plan over the semesters?". Over the course of the semester, our team is planning on looking into churn, meal plan pricing predictions, how ratings of the dining halls have changed over time, and more.
