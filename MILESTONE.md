## 2025-02-17: Acquire Data Milestone

### Data Wrangling
This week, we acquired dining data, including multiple Excel sheets, which we processed into separate CSV files for easier manipulation. We have started adding files to the clean folder to make it ready for visualizations and basic explanatory analysis for next week. We combined data from different semesters while ensuring consistent formatting across all files. Additionally, we gathered meal plan pricing information and scraped Reddit for reviews of various dining locations to supplement our analysis. Currently, we are refining the datasets to facilitate seamless integration by rows and columns. Our primary challenge is standardizing the structure of disparate data sources to enable efficient merging and analysis. We are continuously acquiring new data while parallelly processing the existing data into usable formats.

### Technology Plan
Our team has decided to use RStudio and Github as our main software of choice. The reason behind using RStudio is that it has compatibility with R and Python, allowing for some flexibility amongst the group depending on what we are most comfortable using at a given point throughout the project. The plan with these is that we have already cloned our team repository into Rstudio so we each have access to all of the repository files and from there we can create and push changes directly to Github as we progress through the project. Finally, we believe that Rshiny will be our choice for creating the dashboard as most of us are pretty proficient in R overall. While as a group we have little experience with Rshiny, we figure it is something useful to learn for the project and beyond.

### Project Goals
Statistical Superstars' goals for this project are to explore ISU Dining meal plans, prices, and dining hall reviews to analyze the success and return rates of the dining halls. Specifically, we would like to calculate the percentage of students who repurchase meal plans and uncover findings on which student living locations are most likely to purchase and repurchase a meal plan. Additionally, we want to look at how much income ISU Dining brings from meal plans, intending to predict how much income they will receive. Our audience is Iowa State dining.

### Team Evaluation
Our team, the Statistical Superstars, are currently in line with regard to the given timeline. The largest obstacle we have faced was in the data gathering section of last week. Since the team was interested in utilizing private data from the Iowa State University department of dining, we had to wait outside of our time frame for responses giving the "OK" along with the individuals at the department of dining to prep the data for our use cases. The obstacle of having the data publicly available on our github could also cause some issues given that we were instructed to ideally have everything available within the github. Our team discussed this potential issue and we came up with the solution that we would hold the data privately and run our scripts locally to do analysis/modeling. Another primary obstacle for meeting the weekly and end-of-semester goals would be biting off more than we can chew with our planning(since it is currently pretty dynamic because of the tentative data sources). A solution for this issue is to consistently talk about progress at every meeting during class to ensure we all are on track and on the same page. Additionally, we are taking extra steps to avoid this obstacle by providing updates in our groupchat whenever a task is completed/started.

### Exploratory Analysis - Cael
For our exploratory analysis, since our project is in R our group has decided to use the dplyr, tidyr, shiny, and ggplot2/plotly libraries.  Dplyr and tidyr are used for our data cleaning and manipulation while shiny and ggplot2/plotly are being used to create our initial visualizations and eventual dashboards each depending on whether the group wants them to be interactive or not. During our preliminary analysis, the team identified three very important predictors for our eventual model of predicting dining income being price of meal plans, the number of students enrolled, and the type of meal plans themselves. Within each of these predictors, we identified two outlying meal plans that will be disregarded in the model which were RA meal plans that are provided for free by ISU Dining to the RAs of each residence hall. No major issues have arisen during this process so far as the majority has been making simple visualizations and joining/cleaning the data into the team’s needed format before model building begins next week.

### Project Progress
Our team has been working on the initial explanatory phase this week. We have collected all the data we need for now and have started transforming the data to easily bindable formats and standardized the naming conventions to be consistent among the datasets. We have also started our initial explanatory graphs and tables to understand the distribution of the various variables(meal plan and housing location). We have also scrapped some data from Reddit about reviews for various dining halls. We conducted an online Snapchat survey to get the personal preference ranking for the dining halls. All the team members have got the data in their local r studio and connected to the GitHub repo. We have also started testing and creating some dashboard models in R shiny to get some hands-on practice. As a team, we have found an effective way of allocating tasks and ensuring they are done on time by communicating through our Teams channel with updates. We have also decided on some research questions of interest to us. We have decided to move forward to the modeling phase next week, so we are planning to get suggestions from each member for the models they are suggesting and evaluate their efficiency.

### Modeling Plan 
Statistical Superstars is interested in fitting a multiple linear regression model to predict future meal plan pricing, with the potential explanatory variables of meal plan type, the number of students who purchase each plan, students' living situations, and the price as the response variable. We also want to predict the number of students who purchase each meal plan type. This will be achieved by fitting a Poisson regression model to predict future meal plan purchases, with the meal plan type as the explanatory variable and the amount of each meal plan purchased as the response variable. Poisson is used because the response variable is a count, and our data meets the assumption that each student is independent. Additionally, we would like to look into predicting if students will repurchase a meal plan. We currently do not have a concrete idea of what model would be ideal. These models fit well into our current dashboarding plan because we can show visualizations and summary statistics of our variables of interest and tie in what the future may look like with meal plan prices and the number of students who purchase each one. 

### Project Goals - Jonah

Our team, the Satistical Superstars, is coming to a close with data acquisition and cleaning and is shifting our views to modeling, exploratory analysis, and visualization via a dashboard. The primary research question that our team is trying to answer is: "What is the general popularity of the dining centers of Iowa State University?". This is with the hope of presenting our useful findings via an online dashboard to not only our fellow classmates but also to the Department of Dining and other administration at Iowa State University. Additionally, our research is done with the intention of identifying any issues that could be changed with the current dining system to improve the lives of all individuals at Iowa State. One of these issues that we are planning on diving into is the churn rate of various dining plans. Identifying any trends with churn could allow for the Department of Dining to really dial in on their area to maximize student engagement with dining halls. This kind of research would be what we want to portray in our dashboard, "Do individuals with a particular dining plan have a higher churn rate?" "Do people residing in a specific residence building have a higher churn rate?" "Are there ever any cases where instead of churning, the individual downgrades or upgrades their plan over the semesters?". Over the course of the semester, our team is planning on looking into churn, meal plan pricing predictions, how ratings of the dining halls have changed over time, and more.


## 2025-3-02: Exploratory Analysis Milestone

### Brainstorm Dashboard
Statistical Superstars are currently in the process of developing our preliminary plans for the final dashboard. Last week, our team created a preliminary dashboard to "test the waters" with R Shiny because our group doesn't have much experience with the package. This preliminary dashboard was similar to the example demonstrated in class, however, it was catered to the features of our group's dataset. Our team plans to visualize our four primary models via a dashboard. Those are predicting churn, the income of ISU dining, the population of residence halls, and the type of meal plan purchased. One idea that has been brought up and might be explored further is to give the option to switch the model type in each prediction section. The reasoning behind that our professor mentioned that a core motive of the course is to demonstrate everything the undergraduate data science students learn throughout their time at Iowa State University and showcase it. Creating more models for this data could showcase our modeling capabilities and give new data science students (or even people thinking about joining the data science program) to see what these models are capable of in a "real life" scenerio. This also allows these newer students to see how different models interact with our data, which could potentially compliment their introductory classes with understanding the reasoning behind choosing a new model. 


### Data Report - Cael


### Project Progress
This week, Statistical Superstars continued to explore our data by receiving new tables from ISU Residence Halls and transforming/cleaning data. Jonah contacted ISU Residence this week and made a new dataset from the information he received from them. Srika and Cael made helpful plots and visualizations to assist us in narrowing down our interests for what to include in our final dashboard. Alison created two new datasets from our existing dining data by pivoting them to create a row for each ID and their corresponding meal plans/living situations. Our team is very strong at communicating, and we've come up with many great ideas for what to include in our dashboard and how to model our data. Moving forward, we need to decide what models to build and what transformations we need to do to our data to achieve those models. Each team member will contribute by researching the models we decide on (potentially Markov and Poisson) and implementing the initial code.


### Exploratory Analysis

We explored most of the data we gathered.  We made plot and summary tables. We looked at how some new meal plan prices relate to the prices of similar meals that existed earlier. We also decided to use the residence hall and price and previous plans a student took to predict the meal plan. We also wanted to model the meal plan prices. We have made plots looking at meal plan price trends for all the semesters. We also dropped meal plans that were discontinued. We also decided to drop the RA plans because our goal is to predict the expected income, and RA plans usually do not contribute to the income. We also looked proportion of people in different meal plans by housing distribution and found some plans were more popular in apartment-style housing. In contrast, others were more popular in dorms. We have decided to keep some of these visualizations we are just deciding on how to make to more interactive to user input. We also have joined the Google ratings data with the survey we conducted online about people’s preferences for the various dining centers. In the dataset we had for churn rate, we do have a lot of NAs for which we are still thinking about which assumptions would be the most appropriate.
