### Project Goals
Statistical Superstars' goals for this project are to explore ISU Dining meal plans, prices, and dining hall reviews to analyze the success and return rates of the dining halls. Specifically, we would like to calculate the percentage of students who repurchase meal plans and uncover findings on which student living locations are most likely to purchase and repurchase a meal plan. Additionally, we want to look at how much income ISU Dining brings from meal plans, intending to predict how much income they will receive. Our audience is Iowa State dining.

### Team Evaluation
Write a paragraph describing how well your team is working in accomplishing the end-of-semester goal of having a functioning dashboard. 
Include comments on what obstacles might prevent your team from being able to achieve the its weekly and end-of-semester goals and how these obstacles may be overcome. 
(Project progress, how do we feel with where we're at, any barriers)
