5,"Two words can express the best item on the secret menu. Not many people know this, but you have to try the alfredo shake.

5,"This is the best place to eat on ISU campus. During the day when food is all you can eat you can have as much fancy coffee that you want. They have spot that serves Starbucks like drinks. The only drinks they don't server are blended ice drinks; which is fine by me. Also, there food selection is great. They have a sandwich of the day that is always delicious. Overall, if it are going to eat on campus eat at conversation. Not everyone can find where it is, but once found you know you will want to go back. Of course this is not the best place in town, far from it; but, this is the best place to eat if living on campus and purchased meal bundles",Conversations Dining,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNBbko3TnVnRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x85557bc4b60f6131!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgICAnJ7NugE%7CCgsInu2usgUQgLDjLQ%7C?hl=en,11/17/2015

3,"Conversations does it better than Seasons, depending on your tongue. For me it hits a little better. They are way more consistent in the service category, where I get actual words from the employees who work diligently in the kitchen. They also have a couple of superior options to Seasons across the street, however the size proportions and quality can be inconsistent. I think the one thing that has me most scratching my head is why they would decide to have it be a get & go only location.

Not sit down, gotta walk across street to sit down and eat. My side was cilantro lime rice which I usually enjoy at other food places, but it tasted old/weird and entirely lacking flavor. Even the rice had a weird/old texture. Also is awkward trying to see the food in order to know what you want.

5,"Seasons is definately one of the best dining halls at Iowa State. It is a relatively large hall, do there are usually tons of options when eating there. The buffet usually contains desirable dishes, but sometimes is just average. Definately check the ISU dining before going, to see if they have dishes you're interested in. Also, my opinion is that they have the best pizza of any other hall, which is a plus. They also have WORKING ice cream machines, and a whole ice cream topping center if you're into sweets. Also, it's nice to not thar Seasons is one of the two dining centers that are open throughout the whole weekend.Overall, seasons is one of the best dining halls, in my opinion.",Seasons Marketplace,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMwX1pyY2ZnEAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xd1aee3a51a1b97fd!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIC0_Zrcfg%7CCgwI_rrv7AUQ4NeDygM%7C?hl=en,10/8/2019

1,"Unless you plan on living off pizza and pasta during your time here at Iowa state seasons marketplace is absolutely terrible, everything is deep fried and sodium loaded , for example the wood grill has ribs with 3,210 mg of sodium per serving . (Youre meant to consume 2000mg max a day) the food is very unappetizing and the menus are very often misleading, often having things listed not available, and the only thing that would be somewhat macro nutrient friendly the bonsias has been closed for 3 weeks straight. If youre planning on eating after 7 30 pm forget it , unless like I mentioned you would like to live off burned pizza and stale pasta. Its ridiculous that students pay a mandatory $2,000 for a meal plan for which most days has next to nothing nutritious. As a first year student I dont plan on returning next year to live on campus, I hope they are able to make some changes and idk maybe have things that are actually beneficial to someones health rather than attempting to give people kidney stones with the insane amounts of sodium in the food options .",Seasons Marketplace,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUQ2eHRMZkd3EAE!2m1!1s0x0:0xd1aee3a51a1b97fd!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgID6xtLfGw%7CCgwI69jJigYQsO_93gE%7C?hl=en,9/28/2021

4,"Known by everyone as UDCC, this community center is packed with the amenities that supplement dorm life for the nearby Friley Hall, Helser Hall, Eaton Hall and Martin Hall. UDCC hosts the mail distribution center, office space, public restrooms, and three dining options. The main cafeteria is not open all the time but has a high capacity and good selection from many options. Clyde's has been newly renovated and provides a more compact feel, similar to a dine-in place. The C Store is like a gas station without the pumps, lots of snack food options and subs to go. All dining is compatible with the meal plan information stored on the Student ID, it's as easy as a swipe of your card. During my two years in Eaton Hall UDCC was a frequent lunch and supper stop for me. It is convenient to walk across the courtyard whenever I feel hungry, and it was good peace of mind to know I didn't have to worry about a package getting left out in the open, everything is processed through the mail desk and it is very secure. UDCC may often be busy and crowded during the lunch rush but it became an important part of my home away from home where I could meet up with friends, grab a bite, or dash out of the rain to wait for the bus. Take time to see what it can be for you",Union Drive Community Center,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChdDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURRc0l6cjhRRRAB!2m1!1s0x0:0x14513638c53ddcf6!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDQsIzr8QE%7CCgwI3Mf83AUQqP702AI%7C?hl=en,9/17/2018

5,"Best of the 3 dining halls on campus and it's not even close. Their butter chicken is easily my favorite thing I've ever eaten, and they also put out some incredible Italian meatballs, tikka masala, Chinese foods, and gyro meat, depending on the day. When they don't have any of that, there's usually some kind of rice or chicken available, and they also have pizza during all hours of operation that is WORLDS better than the crappy ones they make at Seasons/UDM. Finally, a variety of desserts including great ice cream 24/7 that's made by local farms and rotates flavors, from chocolate chip to coffee to sherbets to just plain old french vanilla. They're also happy to accomodate dietary needs or refill condiments, if you ask -- just as the other two dining halls are.

The first time I tried Powermilk, and I was able scale the Campanile, take a Calc III exam remotely and grab a a goose as it flew by, all before jumping down in front of a group of touring students. The man leading the group slowly turned, gave a little chuckle, and said ""That's a lot of power!"" I looked up past his bushy beard and saw that it was Steve Butler himself! He instantly gave me an A in not only Calc III, but in all the previous Calculus classes I had ever taken. Feeling powerful, I let go of the goose and galloped back to Friley Windows for another sip.

1,terrible place to eat. They literally served hot cheetoh dust with lasagna. Like who does that?? Who would have the audacity to think of that combination and think that's okay. on top of that the food is near expiration so if you try to take it home you have less time to eat it then Wendy Winterstein allows to pay back student loans. overall this place is pretty bad and would not recommend. - Seasons Gang,Friley Windows,https://www.google.com/maps/reviews/data=!4m8!14m7!1m6!2m5!1sChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURLNU1iWkVREAE!2m1!1s0x0:0x1edbbdcc6207dd0!3m1!1s2@1:CIHM0ogKEICAgIDK5MbZEQ%7CCgwIydGxhAYQ2JK7lwE%7C?hl=en,4/30/2021

So there I am, sitting at the table facing the drink machines against the right wall as you walk in, and this student walks up to the cup rack. He grabs a cup from wide variety of options and proceeds to pour water into said cup. To this day, I have no idea what was going through this kid's head, but the mf whole ass *tosses the cup in the air* trying to flip it and catch it, but instead, he fails to grab hold after it comes back down and water goes fucking everywhere. To say I was struggling to retain my laughter would be an understatement.

And second, have the decency to maximize the space between us. At least leave one seat. There is no need to be directly across from me.

I get that it isn't a large dining hall, but the quality of the food isn't what it should be for a 2 year old dining hall. 

Windows has had major issues with:
-Serving raw or undercooked meat
-Incorrectly labeling food 
-Incorrectly or not listing allergens

Some other issues that are not as bad:
-Late night food is nothing but pizza and salad most of the time (problem for people with allergies) 
-Allergen free options are awful and mainly just vegan options

2,"Four years ago convos had espresso machines, there were 3 sides per meal bundle, there were no such things as “flex” meals, a meal swipe was a meal swipe. 

The next year they removed the espresso machines from convos, made meal bundles jump down to 2 sides per meal.

The next year they introduced flex meals - 35 per semester and the unlimited plans, while raising the prices of all the meal plans.

This year they lowered the amount of express meals, removed caribou, destroyed froots selection and renaming it “whirlybirds”, and lowered the amount of flex meals yet again, while introducing a cyflex plan for those who relied on flex meals.

Meal plans were pretty simple, a swipe was a swipe anywhere.  If you wanted to buy something that was a bundle, you'd use your dining dollars.

Now there's a lot of confusion, swiping in a friend subtracts from your dining dollars, limited flex meals, less amounts of food from bundles, and more.

So how does ISU lose money from this?  There are many meals that are left over from the fold plans at end of semesters.

I guess that the campus empties out and it is pretty lonely and bleak during the winter break. For folks who do stay back, how do you get to dining halls in the snow, if at all they stay open. If not, do we just have to grab a bite at Convos? where else can we get a bite on campus? Do we just use our dining dollars?

Also, what do you do to stay sane when the campus empties out? Not that the campus is hopping currently.

5,"Here's a starter list

• Downtown Ames for cute local businesses, restaurants, the farmers market, well established bars, public art, Octagon Arts Center, and even the really nice library

• Campustown for student centered nightlife, dive bars, local businesses and restaurants. Clouds is an awesome coffee shop on the top level of Legacy Tower with great views of campus

• Somerset for a nice place to walk. It was intended to be another downtown environment, but most businesses are just financial services or clinics. However, The Cafe, Wallaby's, Brick Town, and El Azteca are all successful local restaurants worth visiting

• Campus is a great place to walk, see interesting architecture, find lots of public art funded by the Iowa Public Art For Public Buildings initiative, go to 3 great museums,, watch wildlife at Lake Laverne, go to live music events at the Memorial Union, go to college sports events, and enjoy the beauty of the four seasons, especially in April and October 

• Reiman Gardens for the indoor tropical butterfly enclosure, conservatory- especially during winter, the wonderful 12 or so different gardens with noticeable changes throughout the year, awesome events for Christmas and Halloween, and excellent rotating sculpture displays 

• Throughout town is a great bike trail system, part of the central Iowa trails. The trails connect most parts of the town and its parks system, which is also worth visiting for places like Ada Hayden Lake, Tedesco Environmental Learning Corridor, Moore Memorial Park, North River Valley Park at the whitewater rapids, and Inis Grove Park 

• Story County has lots of hiking trails, especially along the Skunk River Greenbelt. McFarland Park is quite nice, even found a natural 4' waterfall there. Most are managed by Story County Conservation, but even in Ames, public land for hiking can be found at Pammel Woods, Munn Woods, and Reactor Woods. Please treat these areas well if you go

• Lockwood Cafe and Reliable St are totally a hidden gem, with tons of artwork and cool graffiti on all sides of the building inside and out, an indoor skate ramp upstairs at WeCycle, great events like open mic night, outdoor movie showings, and they even had a passenger rail event to Boone. The surrounding grounds also have a small children's garden, really unique wooden play feature designed by architecture students, free community garden on a first come first serve basis, and free thrift store",Seasons Marketplace,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/1b5g6q6/things_to_do_and_hidden_gems_in_ames/,3/3/2024

4,"I was skeptical at first yet it exceeded my expectations. Shoutout all the homies at Seasons who worked their asses off. 

Presentation: I was pleasantly surprised when I saw my spread of wonderful Thanksgiving classics. Turkey - decent portion size, lean and carved right in front of you at Wood Grill. Carrots - seasoned well but lacking some major roasting. Yukon mashed potatoes - basic. Gravy - wasn't very promising. Cranberry Relish - cute little portion size, typical. Pumpkin pie - perfect amount of whipped cream, looked great! Cornbread ”dressing“ - It‘s called stuffing but ok...looked unreasonably moist. Powermilk - ok I‘m just messing around. 

Flavor & Texture: This is obviously the most important category. I was both satisfied and disappointed. Let's start with some sides. Cranberry Relish - good flavor but you know it comes from a can. Carrots - disappointing, very soft and sweet yet cold and flavorless. Cornbread dressing - So good. I actually really enjoyed the classic stuffing flavor and texture was just right! Now for the bulk of the meal...Yukon mashed potatoes - quite natural taste, barely any seasoning but that's what gravy is for. Gravy - tasteful, warm, scrumptious. Turkey - lean and tasty, quite dry but then again gravy. Pumpkin pie - delicious, and accompanied my meal perfectly. 

I can honestly say I was fulfilled with this meal. It really shocked me how well Seasons and presumably the other dining halls did with this. As I walked past the overflowing dish line, praying for my poor coworkers, I reflected on my meal and smiled a little with a sense of nostalgia and happiness that I got to have a somewhat normal Thanksgiving.

When using a meal for Froots, Hawthorne or Clyde's, you're actually loosing money every time. I used to buy a 50 meal block, which was roughly $10.50 a meal, but a typical bundle at Clyde's or Hawthorne is like $8-$9, so you're losing ~$2 every meal you use. When using a bundle for Froots, you're spending $10.50 on a $6 smoothie, losing even more. The only instance where you're not losing money would be at Seasons/UDCC/Conversations where a meal cost $11 but if you buy enough Dining Dollars, you get a discount though, so even that evens out for the same cost.



So overall, you're going to save money on pretty much any meal bundle you use, have more freedom for your meals (Don't have to get 2 sides or can get whatever you want from the C-Store for a ""side"" instead for pretty much same price), and have the ability to use those extra dining dollars on whatever the hell you want.




In this post I use estimates, but I actually spent some time going through the actual numbers comparing a 50 meal block to equivalent dining dollars and the math checks out. This might not be true for the 25 meal blocks, but it should be even if anything. Also, the prices for blocks/DD can change so this might not be true for future years. Double check the math if you're hesitant and you should come to the same conclusion, just trying to help people out with this advice.",Union Drive Community Center,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/5797mz/for_those_of_you_buying_meal_blocks_dont_buy/,10/13/2016

ISU Dining has, is and always will be an over-bloated, taxpayer funded, poorly managed, waste of money part of the university.

4,">Are you seriously doubting a college kids ability to get 2.6k calories with one all you can eat buffet every single day? 

In a healthy way, yes. The majority of healthy foods are not very calorie dense, so it's difficult, but not impossible to get enough calories in one meal when you're solely eating healthy. Think three large plates of food in one sitting. Is this something you've actually done yourself? I've eaten one meal per day before, and I either had to spend an annoying long time eating the meal, or I had to eat snacks during the day to lessen the meal beforehand.

>And I still can't grasp how you think that an all you can eat buffet twice a day is going to be 100% super healthy whereas any other meal someone eats at any other location is going to be super unhealthy. 

Stop putting words in my mouth. The other places you've been mentioning are fast food places, so that's what I was responding to. I think you need to read up on nutrition. The UDCC has lots of unhealthy options, but if you avoid those, it actually has lots of healthy options that would actually be somewhat expensive to buy yourself, including organic apples, blueberries, steak, etc.

You've been advocating snacking on fast food, pizza, chips, pop, all things that at are terrible for your health.
The UDCC's food is very healthy, provided you eat the right things.

I had club meetings, study sessions, parties, etc. that I went to as a freshman, the thing you do is simply plan ahead and eat your meals around them, because (as I have been saying) the amount of food you get from those engagements is never very substantial. If you have too many meals, you can get a to go meal and store it for later.

So the more meals you get per week, the smaller the meal will be, but the cheaper it will also be. So 14 meals would be fine, because you could store any extra meals in your fridge. Therefore no need for extra snack food.

3,"A lot of people seem to think that ISU is acting like it's making money for shareholders or something. State schools are non-profit so its not like anyone is making a profit off owning it.

I'd guess that they have to make up money in places they have control over to offset that which they dont. The Iowa Legislature took away 4.5 million dollar from ISU (and Iowa I think) because they claimed they didnt have the budget for it. Not to mention the 4.5 million was taken back after it was given to ISU, so ISU was effectively in debt to the Legislature.

Its supposedly a zero sum game.

Most professors haven't gotten inflation raises for a while or other raises afaik. Additionally there have been a lot of new hires in departments that are growing quickly like Engineering, which doesnt help the budget (even though this is departmental, but the school as a whole kind of shares money but its complicated and has to do with research money etc.)

And there are other factors fo how funding works. Money donated to the school through private donors are required to be attached to a project or service. So when the football team got a donation for new helmets (not sure if that is a thing, but just as an example), that money couldn't be used for anything other than football equipment.

A lot of contracts for restaurants also ended, like Subway and Caribou. When the contract was done ISU dining decided it was cheaper to operate their own, that's why the MU is completely different and why the Hub is being renovated.

I agree the food isnt as good as it's used to, I especially miss Convos late night bundles. I am just trying to suggest possible reasons for why its happening.

I also agree it feels like a rip, especially since he required meal plans on campus.

I'd be more angry about how much spending is ultimately mishandled by people and if that is leading to monetary issues in the school.

Sorry for the long post, this is just some of the things I have heard from professors and other people who work as ISU.

The man leading the group slowly turned, gave a little chuckle, and said ""That's a lot of power!"" I looked up past his bushy beard and saw that it was Steve Butler himself! He instantly gave me an A in not only Calc III, but in all the previous Calculus classes I had ever taken. Feeling powerful, I let go of the goose and galloped back to Friley Windows for another sip.

4,"I lived in Helser. Welcome to ISU!

Meal Plans - you have to have one. Get the smallest available, trust me you will probably have plenty and if not can buy more. There is a certain time frame to switch meal plans so keep an eye on that but start with the smallest. iirc meals expire at the semester and dining dollars expire at the year. Dining dollars buy you stuff in the convenience store and other places around campus so if you still have some left at the end of the semester you can buy non perishable foods or the non food items (staples and ibuprofen and stuff like that.)

The 2 main dining centers are in the UDCC (big building right there, can't miss it. you will also get mail and packages here). First is the one upstairs (Union Drive Marketplace) I was never much of an early riser so I didn't have breakfast often but a selection of donuts, eggs, pancakes, waffles (make your own any time of day), and other breakfasty stuff was all okay. They have different stations with different foods. you can check out the website to see whats one the menu for each of the different places. http://www.dining.iastate.edu/menus
In general I thought their food was run through a ""de-flavorizer"". The pizza can often be undercooked and they managed to ruin pancakes for me once. PANCAKES. thats some skill right there (or severe lack of) but for the most part it was a solid OK to MEH. They do have a soft serve ice cream/fro yo thing so beware the Freshman 15. 

Second up is Clyde's. I prefered to eat there. You can order online (idr the website, look for it when you walk in or ask) to avoid the line. Godfather's pizza and overall food quality is slightly better, if not the choice of a buffet. You get entree, drink, and 2? sides. Often I saved a side or two in my mini fridge for the days you don't want to leave the building for food and was still satisfied. 

When it comes down to it dorms and meal bundles are way expensive. I paid something like $7,000 or so my freshman year on just housing and food. Break down your meal bundle to the price per meal, its probably upwards of $6-7 a meal. That's almost restaurant prices. How many of those meals are spent on a single bowl of cereal? Right now I live in UV, and pay $2700 a year for apt with all utilities paid (dated and has its problems but by fair best price you can get in ames) except gas. I'm not great about marking exactly what I spend on what but I guarantee I haven't spent even close to $4300 on food. Hell I'd be surprised if it was greater than $1500. That's almost three grand in savings right there. I don't have to get dressed and leave my space if I want to go get food. I can eat on my hours, not only when dining center is open, and have what I want made how I like it. I have my own bedroom and we have a full kitchen and living room. We have a fenced in patio (abiet not huge). Dorms are great for your first year, but sophomore year you should definitely look into UV or other options.

4,">Man you are like the world's biggest college dining center fan. 

I'm just opposed to your idea that getting more dining dollars is a good idea, if I understand you correctly. And I don't think 1 UDCC meal per day is advisable for the general freshman body, at least in the certain terms that you state it.

> I never met one person in Friley or MWL or anywhere that got too few meals and complained about not having enough swipes.

It was their decision to get that many meals. They're probably just replacing their meal with snacks, pizza, beer, coffee etc.",Union Drive Community Center,/r/iastate/comments/4csd5v/how_are_foods_from_isu_dining_hall/d1ldx9d/,3/31/2016

2,"I work at UDCC, there is a deep worker shortage, so in order for us students to not get out at unreasonably late times (which we were for the first week), serving on paper plates allows the dish room to focus on cleaning pans which is what was keeping us so late.",Union Drive Community Center,/r/iastate/comments/pgrcmq/udcc/hbdfxsw/,9/2/2021

3,"This has been a problem for a couple years. I've stop eating at the west side dining areas completely. When I  lived on campus in 2018-19 the food at udcc was really good in the fall. Burgers, grilled cheese or chicken tenders at least 4-5 days a week. Suddenly the pizza became greasy dough with tomato water and whatever that gooey stuff on top it is. The foods I listed would maybe show up 2 times a week. And when they served it it would be gone by 1pm. I almost never eat before 2pm so I would pay for my meal walk in and see that the only things left were a halal hot dog and vegan tenders. As a picky eater It's not worth a swipe to go in to these dining centers only to find the only thing left that's appetizing is the cereal bar. This year I've been exclusively going to convos and the mu because of they don't have what I want I can leave before I waste money on something I don't want. If they stop the take out options after the pandemic then I probably won't get a meal plan again. It just feels like the quality goes down each semester but the price goes up. The only reason $11 for a meal is worth it is because its convenient.",Union Drive Community Center,/r/iastate/comments/iwpgg6/food_shortages_at_dining_centers/g6308h3/,9/21/2020

2,"Jesus fuck.  I was there from 06-12.  They built seasons in MWL in 2010ish AND had just remodeled Oak-Elm.  Wallace was half full and Wilson wasnt a thing, but they had a dining facility.  What ever happened to the shitty towers getting torn down?  Did ol' Pete Englin decide to buy another mansion?  Fuck.

Before the ""new"" rec center was built in the suites parking lot, there was talk of adding another dining facility, but Friley?!  The fucking mice and cockroaches in food stores are terrible.

TL;DR.  Time does crazy things
