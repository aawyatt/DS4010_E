Post,"In light of recent posts, I wanted to share a classic gem from my experiences at Seasons last year. So there I am, sitting at the table facing the drink machines against the right wall as you walk in, and this student walks up to the cup rack.

To this day, I have no idea what was going through this kid's head, but the mf whole ass *tosses the cup in the air* trying to flip it and catch it, but instead, he fails to grab hold after it comes back down and water goes fucking everywhere.

This is wrong on several levels. First off, please spare me the question. I'm eating and don't want to talk with my mouth full. You and I can both see that no one is sitting there.

And second, have the decency to maximize the space between us. At least leave one seat. There is no need to be directly across from me.

Post,"At least in my experience First Property Management has been awful beyond belief. This serves as a warning to those looking for apartments. I went through them last year and really regret it.

When I moved into my apartment all of the Windows were open with water having covered parts of things. The apartment itself was really obviously not inspected or was damaged during the summer. Blatant things like a door stop ripped off of a door, a string for blinds that was in the middle of the living room. We didn't have working internet for about a month and even after we finally did things broke a while down because the cable jack wasn't installed correctly.

More than the apartment itself, FPM has been awful to deal with. One time they came to do fireplace inspections. When I came back to my apartment at midnight I was completely locked out because the maintenance worker had apparently ripped the key out of the door and broke the mechanism. The emergency maintenance worker was unavailable until the next day and even then he didn't respond to my message until I called him a second time. There was another time when pipes blocked up and my sink and dish washer filled with sewer water. This time someone luckily came in a few hours to fix it.

Come time to move out they try to get more money from you stating your carpets must be professionally cleaned with a receipt or you can do their ""special"" where instead they just take $100 off your deposit. I am still fighting to actually get my deposit since they sent it a month late to the wrong address (I came in once I got back to Ames to change the address since they hadn't sent it out for some reason). Even now they are stating they can only give me my deposit if they receive the check back from the wrong address they sent it to.

For your own sake, avoid them at all costs. Maybe you'll have a better experience but if mine is indicative of how they act you'll be in for a ride.",15,19,0.8,51h8ed,,9/6/2016,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/51h8ed/you_should_avoid_first_property_management/,"Friley Windows,"

Post,"Over the past 2 years of living in the Res halls, I have had nothing but bad experiences at Windows.

I get that it isn't a large dining hall, but the quality of the food isn't what it should be for a 2 year old dining hall. 

Windows has had major issues with:
-Serving raw or undercooked meat
-Incorrectly labeling food 
-Incorrectly or not listing allergens

Some other issues that are not as bad:
-Late night food is nothing but pizza and salad most of the time (problem for people with allergies) 
-Allergen free options are awful and mainly just vegan options

Compared to seasons, UDCC, and even Storms, it's sad to see a new dining center just not on par with any other dining center.

Post,"Hi everyone,

I'm your resident bird person! I've been attempting to record the locations of where birds have been hitting windows on campus, along with identifying the species/age/sex of the birds and potentially donating them to the university so they can be used for educational purposes (note: this requires a special permit. It's against the law to keep parts of migratory birds).

**If you find a dead bird on campus, please send me a PM that includes the location (building, which side of the building), and if you can, a close-up photo.**

COVID has made my collection process a lot more difficult, so I can't always get to the birds to get a photo myself. If you give me a photo and location, I can at least record it on an online database (which can be used to inform decisions about bird-safe design at the campus and potentially municipal level).

This information can be really important. Many things threaten bird populations, like habitat degradation, insecticides, and outdoor cats, and window collisions are no exception. We usually see a large increase of window collisions during migration, which happens from March-May and again August-October. The fall migration is usually especially fatal for populations, because it's directly after the breeding season, and young birds are very susceptible to flying into glass. The City of Ames recently announced that we are the first town in Story County to be ""bird friendly,"" which is a wonderful step for conservation, but I do feel that the city and the ISU campus can be doing more to prevent window collisions (solutions do exist!).

Thanks for your time, everyone!

u/BlankeTheBard (she/her)

Edit: We're supposed to have millions upon millions of birds migrating over the state tonight. I'll probably be out tomorrow morning to see what the damages are.

Edit: I walked around the Design building, SIC, Parks, Bessey, and the Sukup Atrium this morning. I found three deceased Ovenbirds (a very cute species of warbler), and two alive but stunned birds (Nashville Warbler and Common Yellowthroat). I moved those two off the sidewalk and into some bushes. I do hope they recovered safely!

Edit: I'm honestly blown away by the number of reports I've been getting from y'all over reddit. I really appreciate it. I understand that the messaging feature on here doesn't have an 'attach photo' option. You'll either need to upload photos to imgur, or I can give you my contact information so you can send it another way.

Post,"Hey, everyone! Your fellow bird nerd here.

I've posted a couple times over the past year about how windows kill birds via collisions, and how I've received funding earlier this year to look into how our campus impacts migratory bird populations.

I've gotten a biology professor and a handful of freshmen biology/animal ecology students to help me monitor some buildings here on campus, which is very exciting. Personally, I'll be looking at some buildings on the west side of campus almost every day of the week (so if you see someone skulking around a building and picking up dead birds from the sidewalk, stop by and say hi!). We will be monitoring specific buildings to provide an estimation of how many birds ISU buildings kill over the course of the annual migrations.

However! We have permits to collect any specimens in Iowa! If you spot a dead bird on campus that seems to be in good condition (i.e. the body is intact), please comment here or shoot me a PM! The specimens will be donated back to the university and used for educational purposes!

Other benefits of me collecting the bodies include:

* you and your fellow students won't have to look at as many dead birds on your way to class

* it lowers the number of scavengers on our campus

* it may help us make Iowa State a bird-friendly campus in the future

And before anyone mentions it: yes, we will be monitoring that new building on the west side of campus once construction is complete in 2020.

Don't hesitate to ask me questions about this important issue!

Post,"Four years ago convos had espresso machines, there were 3 sides per meal bundle, there were no such things as ‚Äúflex‚Äù meals, a meal swipe was a meal swipe. 

The next year they removed the espresso machines from convos, made meal bundles jump down to 2 sides per meal.

The next year they introduced flex meals - 35 per semester and the unlimited plans, while raising the prices of all the meal plans.

This year they lowered the amount of express meals, removed caribou, destroyed froots selection and renaming it ‚Äúwhirlybirds‚Äù, and lowered the amount of flex meals yet again, while introducing a cyflex plan for those who relied on flex meals.

Meal plans were pretty simple, a swipe was a swipe anywhere.  If you wanted to buy something that was a bundle, you'd use your dining dollars.

Now there's a lot of confusion, swiping in a friend subtracts from your dining dollars, limited flex meals, less amounts of food from bundles, and more.

So how does ISU lose money from this?  There are many meals that are left over from the fold plans at end of semesters.

**Public Health Measures for Campus**

*Face coverings* are encouraged but not required for most areas.  They're required in specific spaces, including:

* public transportation (CyRide; Transportation Security Administration requirement)

* Ames Laboratory facilities (U.S. Department of Energy requirement)

* healthcare settings, including Thielen Student Health Center

* areas of the College of Veterinary Medicine where they're normally required

* research laboratories, as determined by principal investigator or lab supervisor

*Vaccination* is encouraged but not required.

**Background** 

* [Policy direction from Iowa Board of Regents](https://www.iowaregents.edu/news/board-news/statement-from-president-mike-richards-lifting-regents-state-of-emergency), issued May 20, 2021

* [Iowa House File 889](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ba=HF%20889&ga=89), enacted May 20, 2021.

* [ISU senior leadership memo to campus](https://www.president.iastate.edu/communications/messages/2021/8/10-fall21), issued August 10, 2021

*****

**Public Health Status**

It ain't where we were last November, but it's a long way from being good.

Statewide, we are seeing an ongoing surge, almost exclusively the Delta strain.  Hospitals are low on space due to a combination of factors - new COVID cases, a backlog of elective or non-emergent procedures that they were trying to clear over the summer, and other seasonal illnesses.  This combines with a dwindling healthcare workforce (many people have decided to seek other professions because of fatigue and frustration) and a remaining workforce that is exhausted.

Locally, Mary Greeley Medical Center's numbers of admitted COVID patients have been up for the past month.  **In the past 7 days, 75% of new COVID cases in Story County have been from the 18-29 age range and 100% have been the Delta strain**.

*****

**Testing Status**

Currently, we do not have a mass testing site operating on campus.  If you're a student and symptomatic, you can schedule a test through Thielen Student Health Center - [go to their site](https://health.iastate.edu/) and hit the Appointments link at the bottom right corner of the page.

Iowa closed its TestIowa sites over the summer due to low positivity rates and low utilization.  The state's preferred testing methods today are to see your normal healthcare provider or to [pick up a home test kit](https://www.testiowa.com/en/) ([FAQ here](https://health.iastate.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FAQ-Public-Test-Iowa-Pick-Up-Site-7.16.21.pdf) - hooray, self-service saliva science).  Thielen Student Health Center is a pick-up location.  We also have satellite pick-up locations at Union Drive Community Center and the Memorial Union, though those aren't listed on the TestIowa site.

*****

**Vaccine Status**

Last Friday, August 13, the FDA and CDC issued final approval for immunocompromised individuals to receive COVID booster shots (third dose) of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine formulations, eight months after their second shots.  Immunocompromised people make up roughly 3% of the U.S. adult population - but account for 44% of hospitalized breakthrough infections (i.e., infections in vaccinated persons).

About an hour ago, the FDA and CDC [released a statement](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/08/18/joint-statement-hhs-public-health-and-medical-experts-covid-19-booster-shots.html) that third-dose boosters of Pfizer and Moderna will be recommended for the general population starting September 20.  As with the limited approval for immunocompromised individuals, the general population approval is for eight months after second dose, so healthcare personnel will be the first to receive third doses.  We'd been seeing the same news reports as all of you but the official green light is very new, so at this time I can't say anything more about how we'll handle that on campus.

At this time, there's no official statement on a booster dose for people who received the J&J vaccine.  Stay tuned for more news.

On campus, we continue to offer vaccination clinics with Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson formulations.  [See my previous post for the current schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/ozcliq/fall_21_covid_vaccination_clinics_more_dates/).

**Perspective, and What You Can Do to Help**

Unpopular opinion up front: everything I'm hearing from public health colleagues who study epidemiology indicates that we are unlikely to ever eradicate COVID-19 completely.  A more realistic goal is reducing its transmissibility to a point that normal public health controls can manage individual cases or local outbreaks before they generate mass hospitalizations or deaths.

That hinges on vaccination.

All of our previous public health measures - face coverings, online classes, canceled football games, social distancing, salad bar sneeze guards in front of podiums - all of those efforts were to buy us time for vaccine development and deployment.  Remember all of the ""flatten the curve"" graphics from spring of '20?  We made that happen.  We weren't stacking bodies on Mary Greeley's loading dock and we didn't have to turn Lied Rec into a field hospital - not because COVID wasn't so bad, but because enough people complied with the protective measures that we did hold back the tide.

For the last year and a half, we as a country have done a crappy job of managing the mental health aspect of this disaster.  America's mental health apparatus was a traveshamockery before COVID.  Now I fear we're going straight from a COVID pandemic into a mental health epidemic, [especially for you and other students across the country](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/08/17/suicidal-ideation-rise-college-aged-adults-due-covid-19-pandemic).  In studies of disaster survivors' mental health, we see that they have better short- and long-term outcomes if they're given agency and a list of productive actions to take.  ""Stay home and stay away from people"" was pretty much the geometic opposite of that.

**Getting vaccinated is the number one thing you can do to protect yourself and others**.  If there was ever a case of ""it's not about you,"" this is it.  No, vaccination is not a 100% guarantor of never getting COVID - but that shouldn't be news because *no* vaccine is 100% effective.  However, it:

* reduces your chance of catching COVID;

* reduces your chance of severe symptoms if you do catch COVID; 

* reduces your chance of transmitting infection to others; and

* reduces the likelihood that high transmission rates will generate a mutation that's worse than Delta.

The other part of this is to change the conversation around vaccination so it becomes a social norm.  ISU can't require you to disclose your vaccination status (see the link above to HF 889 for the reason why).  The current interpretation of that is that as ISU employees, my colleagues and I can't even ask the question.  *But you can.*  You can ask your friends and classmates and partners about their vaccination status (and, without making this a conversation about sex and dating, vaccination status might be one of several things you might want to know about a potential hookup...).  You can help make vaccination something that is expected - ""when did you get vaccinated?"" rather than ""are you vaccinated?""

The tricky part - and my hypocrisy knows no bounds here, because my frustration often exceeds my patience and compassion these days - is making it a non-judgemental, non-accusatory conversation.  Public shaming can feel satisfying in the short term but it rarely brings about the behavioral change we desire, and if it does, that change comes with undesired baggage.  If someone has concerns about side-effects or needle anxiety, you can help them through that (or /u/CycloneHealth can).  If someone has bad information about vaccination, you can provide them more current and accurate data points.  This, by the way, is also a part of the mental health issue I mentioned above - for both you and them.  Let's stop marinating our brains in cortisol.

There are other things you can do, too.  Face coverings are currently recommended indoors, even for fully-vaccinated people, and I'm pretty sure many of you stuffed them in your underwear drawers rather than throwing them away.  Now is the time to consider pulling them back out (and washing them - ew) and bringing them to class with you again.  Weigh the real value of the 801 Day Superspreader Sausagefest - you can get just as drunk at a smaller gathering where you can actually hear the conversations.  And don't lick door handles or other people's stuff.

**Original message from Tuesday 12/14 continues below:**

As if finals week didn't suck enough, the National Weather Service held a briefing call this afternoon to discuss the severe weather threat for Wednesday.

**TL;DR: sustained winds 25 to 40 mph, gusts 55 to 70 mph, possible thunderstorms amplifying gusts to 80 mph or more, isolated tornadoes.  Winds ramping up over the day, first major round between 4:00pm and 8:00pm, then a brief break, then another round overnight.**

While the wind is not currently expected to be as strong as the derecho was, this will be a much longer-lasting weather system.  We can expect these conditions to affect us for as long as 6 to 7 hours.


**Protective Actions**

* *Due to the potential for high wind gusts and windblown debris, treat any severe thunderstorm warnings tomorrow as if they were tornado warnings.  Go indoors, stay away from windows, and be prepared to move to an interior space on the lowest level of the building.*

* Familiarize yourself with the severe weather shelter areas in the buildings where you spend time on campus.  Emergency maps should be posted in central locations (near elevators and stairwells, in most or all classrooms) - look for the green-highlighted areas.  If a tornado warning is issued, move to shelter immediately.  Your life is more important than your final exam.

* Avoid travel Wednesday evening.  If you have to go out, leave extra space between vehicles, minimize all distractions, maintain control of your vehicle with both hands, and avoid traveling next to high-profile vehicles.

* Avoid outdoor activities, even if the warm weather appears inviting.  It's a trap.

* Secure all loose objects and small pets and children that you normally leave outdoors.

* Prepare for power outages.

* Avoid power lines, trees, and other potential falling-on-your-head-or-car hazards.


My team and others across campus will be monitoring this throughout the day, but we may not have time to post here.

Post,"Hello!

As you're all pretty much aware, Iowa State's Spring Break starts this weekend, 3/14-3/22. As you're probably also aware, Iowa State will be moving to Online classes during the two weeks after spring break. Both of these events will impact CyRide's service levels. Additionally, as COVID-19 continues to spread, CyRide has increased measures to disinfect the buses and building area.

* **

**Spring Break:**


Beginning Saturday, 3/14 until Sunday, 3/22, CyRide will be operating a break schedule for Spring Break. Moonlight Express will **not** operate the weekend of 3/13 or 3/20.


Routes that *will not run over* Spring Break:

* #11 Cherry
* #12 Lilac
* #21 Cardinal

Routes that will be *heavily reduced* over spring break:

* #9 Plum
* #23 Orange
* #25 Gold (route also changes)

Route that *changes* over spring break:

* #25 Gold [(Gold route ISU Break Days)](https://www.cyride.com/Home/ShowDocument?id=9437)

If you still use a paper schedule, the shaded lines for the trips do not operate. Additionally, please keep in mind that MyState sometimes has trouble keeping up with our break schedules sometimes. CyRide is not officially affiliated with MyState and has no control over whether the information is correct, or how soon errors get corrected. The best way to receive an accurate time is to utilize the printed schedule information, or give us a call at 515-292-1100.

You can view CyRide's break schedule [here.](https://www.cyride.com/schedules/school-year-schedule/break-schedules)

* **

**The two weeks after Spring Break (3/23 - 4/3):**

~~I just got officially informed yesterday that service will **not** be significantly impacted at this time, with one exception being a modification to Orange route. Please keep in mind that this decision is **subject to change** at any time dependent on load counts.~~

~~CyRide will run what is essentially a normal schedule, with the only modifications being that Orange will run a break schedule, and there will be no extra buses on any trips. Everything else will operate normally and at it's regular school year frequency. Additionally, as of right now, Moonlight will operate normally during the two weeks after Spring Break.~~

Again, please keep in mind that the above is subject to change contingent on ridership. We may start pulling back  service if we cannot justify the bus being out. **Additionally, if classes get moved to online for the remainder of the semester there may be some major modifications implemented.** We're trying to maintain a healthy balance of providing top quality service while also keeping taxpayers and student's dollars in mind. 

Stay up to date with our alerts at www.cyride.com and go to ""Rider alerts.""

* **

**Coronavirus (COVID-19) measures:**

Our first priority at Cyride is safety. As soon as Coronavirus moved into the US, Cyride immediately began to upgrade cleaning protocols and frequency.

Our CyRide laneworking crews are now disinfecting every bus using electric backpack sprayers containing [EcoLab FaciliPro](https://www.gofacilipro.com/). These sprayers also apply a static charge to bring the applied disinfectant to the entire surface. Because it's an electric sprayer, all areas of the bus are decontaminated including seats, pull cords, buttons, windows, doors, and the driver area. Each bus is disinfected daily. Additionally, drivers are encouraged to utilize provided hand sanitizer.

If you're interested, a video of the decontamination process is available on CyRide's facebook page. Simply do a search for CyRide on Facebook and you should be able to find it.

If anyone has any questions about the above, feel free to leave a comment or send me a PM. Hope you all enjoy your three weeks of Spring Break!",8,78,0.98,fhl4b8,,3/12/2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/fhl4b8/cyride_megaupdate_spring_break_service_during_the/,"Friley Windows,"
Post,"Here's a starter list

‚Ä¢ Downtown Ames for cute local businesses, restaurants, the farmers market, well established bars, public art, Octagon Arts Center, and even the really nice library

‚Ä¢ Campustown for student centered nightlife, dive bars, local businesses and restaurants. Clouds is an awesome coffee shop on the top level of Legacy Tower with great views of campus

‚Ä¢ Somerset for a nice place to walk. It was intended to be another downtown environment, but most businesses are just financial services or clinics. However, The Cafe, Wallaby's, Brick Town, and El Azteca are all successful local restaurants worth visiting

‚Ä¢ Campus is a great place to walk, see interesting architecture, find lots of public art funded by the Iowa Public Art For Public Buildings initiative, go to 3 great museums,, watch wildlife at Lake Laverne, go to live music events at the Memorial Union, go to college sports events, and enjoy the beauty of the four seasons, especially in April and October 

‚Ä¢ Reiman Gardens for the indoor tropical butterfly enclosure, conservatory- especially during winter, the wonderful 12 or so different gardens with noticeable changes throughout the year, awesome events for Christmas and Halloween, and excellent rotating sculpture displays 

‚Ä¢ Throughout town is a great bike trail system, part of the central Iowa trails. The trails connect most parts of the town and its parks system, which is also worth visiting for places like Ada Hayden Lake, Tedesco Environmental Learning Corridor, Moore Memorial Park, North River Valley Park at the whitewater rapids, and Inis Grove Park 

‚Ä¢ Story County has lots of hiking trails, especially along the Skunk River Greenbelt. McFarland Park is quite nice, even found a natural 4' waterfall there. Most are managed by Story County Conservation, but even in Ames, public land for hiking can be found at Pammel Woods, Munn Woods, and Reactor Woods. Please treat these areas well if you go

‚Ä¢ Lockwood Cafe and Reliable St are totally a hidden gem, with tons of artwork and cool graffiti on all sides of the building inside and out, an indoor skate ramp upstairs at WeCycle, great events like open mic night, outdoor movie showings, and they even had a passenger rail event to Boone.

Post,"Hi, everyone!

Last semester I asked on here for the locations of dead birds on campus. Kind of morbid and gross, but it was for a good reason!


I wanted to update you guys on it! I received a grant from the Iowa Ornithologists' Union to do a formal study this fall! Without your contribution of information, I probably wouldn't have proceeded with the project.


Here's what it is, and why it's important:

Every year, millions of birds die from window collisions, especially during large migration events in the spring and fall. There are two reasons why this happens: nocturnal migrants are attracted to light, so anything that produces light at night can cause them to crash into things, and during the day, the birds only see the reflections in the windows which makes them perceive it as more habitat.

When this happens, birds can concuss and die directly from those injuries, or are at a higher risk of predation (because they aren't moving and are not alert).

College campuses all over the US are magnets for bird-window collisions: we have large windows, a lot of landscaping close to those windows, and we have lights on at night.

I'm wanting a closer look at window-collision mortality on our very own campus. A student from the [University of Iowa](https://dailyiowan.com/2018/12/04/ui-student-research-found-over-100-birds-collided-into-5-campus-buildings-in-10-weeks/) did a similar study this past fall, and the Ornithology Club at Ohio State University has an ongoing study as well.

The immediate benefit of this study is the removal of bird carcasses from my study sites (TBD). Specimens in nice condition will be donated to the university so that they can be prepared for future animal-oriented classes (many of our current bird specimens are almost 100 years old!). Other specimens will be moved to another location to hopefully discourage scavengers from being on campus (which could potentially put my data and their lives in risk).

The other benefit of carcass removal is that you and prospective student tour groups don't have to look at them!

That was probably more information than anyone here cares about, but I am very excited about investigating this topic and wanted to share that excitement with you folks <3

Thanks!",33,194,0.99,bbzyug,,4/11/2019,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/bbzyug/if_anyone_remembers_me_asking_about_dead_birds_on/,"Friley Windows,"

Hello everyone, and welcome back! Hopefully 2021 is a better year for you all than last year. We've all been through a lot, and I think it's safe to say that everyone is ready for things to be back to normal (fingers crossed for Fall 2021!) There's not really much new to share except a few key things, but just figured I'd keep everyone in the loop at what's going on with CyRide for this Spring. 

---
###Regular service resumes on Monday, 1/25/2021

Normal service will resume on Monday, 1/25, and Moonlight Express will resume on Friday, 1/29. Please keep in mind that we will still run a full break schedule for the week of the 18th, so the please keep the following in mind for next week:

* #21 Cardinal, #11 Cherry, #12 Lilac will not run until Monday, 1/25
* #23 Orange and #9 Plum will have reduced service until Monday, 1/25 *(other routes also have some reduced service, but the impact is minimal. Look for the shaded lines on the printed schedule - those do not run over breaks.)*
* #25 Gold will follow it's break schedule **and route** until Monday, 1/25.

###This one is important: #21 Cardinal and #23 Orange routes are back on regular route!

For nearly the past two years, #21 Cardinal and #23 Orange routes were on a detour due to the Gerdin Business Building expansion which resulted in the Wallace Road closure. Construction was completed right when ISU went on Winter Break. For some of you, you may only know the detour version of these routes. If you're not familiar with the correct routes, you may want to brush up. [Here](https://www.cyride.com/Home/ShowDocument?id=9451) is the map of Cardinal's regular route, and [Here](https://www.cyride.com/Home/ShowDocument?id=9435) is Orange's regular route. Please note that Cardinal no longer goes down Morrill road, and Orange no longer goes on Union Drive by the President's house.

---

### #3 Blue Route/South 5th Street

Blue route has also been impacted by construction for quite a while, resulting in the Blue route having to completely bypass South 5th Street. That construction was also completed over break, so we're back on route. However, due to the nature of the road construction, the South Meadows stop and shelter will be permanently closed. Riders that used to use the South Meadows stop will either need to catch the bus at the stops at River Birch or South Walnut.

---

###Moonlight Express

As stated above, MLX resumes on Friday, 1/29. If you're not up to date with the changes to Moonlight express, we've limited fixed-route service to the A Shuttle which services West Ames and East Ames at Duff on 20 minute timetable.

For all other areas, the E shuttle is available, which is basically a late night dial-a-ride. Give CyRide a call any time after 10:00pm (Fridays and Saturdays only) to schedule a pickup and a minibus will be dispatched to your location as soon as possible (including, but not limited to: Ontario Street, Somerset, Schilleter/University Village, Freddy Court, Towers, Research Park/Wessex, Copper Beach/The Grove, and South Duff.) For more information, [the Moonlight Express page](https://www.cyride.com/schedules/school-year-schedule/moonlight-express) on our website should give you the most up to date maps and timetables.

---
###CyRide in inclement weather conditions

With a winter snow storm approaching here in a couple of hours, I figured it would be appropriate to include this, especially because it appears that we're going to have a late winter. CyRide has historically almost never cancelled service due to severe weather conditions. I think there was one instance before my time where we cancelled for one day because the roads were a solid sheet of ice, but other than that we don't really cancel unless it's absolutely necessary for the safety of both drivers and passengers. While rare, it is possible that service is suspended until conditions improve like we've done in the past with flash floods.

**However,** when conditions are severe enough, you should expect late buses and/or missed trips. We will most likely not be guaranteeing transfers if buses start running late. Please keep this in mind if you're planning on riding, and try to catch an earlier bus if you have an appointment. 

The best way you can stay up to date is by following our website, Facebook, and Twitter accounts. We will generally update them if any changes to service occur due to weather disruptions.

###Obligatory COVID update

Though nothing has really changed with our policy, I still feel that it's important to share. Our mask policy has not changed, our drivers are still disinfecting the buses with a peroxide solution when they have down time, and our laneworkers are still completely spraying down the buses at the end of service. When the weather gets a bit nicer, we'll start opening the windows and roof hatches to maximize fresh airflow through the buses.

---

###TL;DR

**TL;DR:** Regular service resumes on Monday, 1/25. During the week of 1/18 be aware of changed service to some routes due to break schedule. Wallace Road is open; #21 and #23 are back on regular route. South Meadows stop closed on Blue Route on South 5th Street. Moonlight express starts 1/29, call if you need a ride if you're outside the A shuttle service zone. For inclement weather, CyRide will most likely still run, but buses might be late. Finally, COVID policy is the same as last year.

Post,"I was skeptical at first yet it exceeded my expectations. Shoutout all the homies at Seasons who worked their asses off. 

Presentation: I was pleasantly surprised when I saw my spread of wonderful Thanksgiving classics. Turkey - decent portion size, lean and carved right in front of you at Wood Grill. Carrots - seasoned well but lacking some major roasting. Yukon mashed potatoes - basic. Gravy - wasn't very promising. Cranberry Relish - cute little portion size, typical. Pumpkin pie - perfect amount of whipped cream, looked great! Cornbread ‚Äùdressing‚Äú - It‚Äòs called stuffing but ok...looked unreasonably moist. Powermilk - ok I‚Äòm just messing around. 

Flavor & Texture: This is obviously the most important category. I was both satisfied and disappointed. Let's start with some sides. Cranberry Relish - good flavor but you know it comes from a can. Carrots - disappointing, very soft and sweet yet cold and flavorless. Cornbread dressing - So good. I actually really enjoyed the classic stuffing flavor and texture was just right! Now for the bulk of the meal...Yukon mashed potatoes - quite natural taste, barely any seasoning but that's what gravy is for. Gravy - tasteful, warm, scrumptious. Turkey - lean and tasty, quite dry but then again gravy. Pumpkin pie - delicious, and accompanied my meal perfectly. 

I can honestly say I was fulfilled with this meal. It really shocked me how well Seasons and presumably the other dining halls did with this. As I walked past the overflowing dish line, praying for my poor coworkers, I reflected on my meal and smiled a little with a sense of nostalgia and happiness that I got to have a somewhat normal Thanksgiving.

Post,"I live in SUV and been buying a mix of meal blocks and some dining dollars for the past few semesters which worked perfectly for a random lunch on campus and a few things from the C-Store here and there, but then started to really think about it. 



When using a meal for Froots, Hawthorne or Clyde's, you're actually loosing money every time. I used to buy a 50 meal block, which was roughly $10.50 a meal, but a typical bundle at Clyde's or Hawthorne is like $8-$9, so you're losing ~$2 every meal you use. When using a bundle for Froots, you're spending $10.50 on a $6 smoothie, losing even more. The only instance where you're not losing money would be at Seasons/UDCC/Conversations where a meal cost $11 but if you buy enough Dining Dollars, you get a discount though, so even that evens out for the same cost.



So overall, you're going to save money on pretty much any meal bundle you use, have more freedom for your meals (Don't have to get 2 sides or can get whatever you want from the C-Store for a ""side"" instead for pretty much same price), and have the ability to use those extra dining dollars on whatever the hell you want.




In this post I use estimates, but I actually spent some time going through the actual numbers comparing a 50 meal block to equivalent dining dollars and the math checks out. This might not be true for the 25 meal blocks, but it should be even if anything. Also, the prices for blocks/DD can change so this might not be true for future years. Double check the math if you're hesitant and you should come to the same conclusion, just trying to help people out with this advice.",7,44,0.98,5797mz,,10/13/2016,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/5797mz/for_those_of_you_buying_meal_blocks_dont_buy/,"Union Drive Community Center,Seasons Marketplace,Conversations Dining,"

Post,"This one's been on my mind for a while.  Less operations today; more reflection.
 
Every culture has its own folklore.  Emergency services are no exception.  Among the closely-held beliefs of those who work the streets and the emergency rooms is the forbidden word.  It's five letters long.  It starts with ""Q.""  If you use it, the condition it describes will cease.
 
I've seen it happen.  The first time was years ago, on a third-shift ride-along with Lexington-Fayette PD.  An officer who really should have known better said the ""Q"" word in roll call.  That shift saw *nine* Signal 7 (officer needs assistance) calls.  I learned what it was like to do 85mph down UK's equivalent of Osborne.  Shortly thereafter, I learned that pepper spray isn't entirely directional.
 
Last fall, someone said it in the emergency operations center a few hours before kickoff of the ISU-UofI game.  We all know how *that* day went.
 
So it is with some trepidation that I consider using the ""Q"" word to describe campus these days.
 
Campus isn't closed, exactly.  It isn't shut down.  But it can feel that way.  Less so, now that the weather is softening and the days are sliding toward the solstice.  But still... in the mornings, I cross Sheldon where West becomes Union, and it's deserted except for CyRide (thank you, drivers and dispatchers, for standing your posts through this).  The morning sun is shining through an empty skywalk between State Gym and Beyer.  I can get across campus to the EOC without seeing another person.

From the EOC, it's easy to lose sight of this.  We're on the edge of campus with no windows.  As we've moved from urgent decision-making and action to sustained coordination and planning, our work has developed a rhythm of its own.  Executive call at 0800, release the day's incident action plan by 0845, workgroup leader calls at 0900 and 1530, get the day's SITREP to the executives by 1700, other coordination and status updates in between all of that.  The status reports and data dumps make it easy to abstract what's happening - and what isn't.
 
But when I can, I get out of the EOC at lunch to walk and see sunlight, and the sidewalks are empty.  A couple of weeks ago, I stood in the middle of Osborne at Lagomarcino just because I could - it was completely devoid of traffic.  There is a slightly unreal quality to the emptiness (and the inaccessibility of the buildings), as if I'm in a glitched level of a game where the scenery has loaded but the NPCs haven't.
 
And yet... campus *isn't* empty.  We still have about 300 students in the residence halls and another 2,500 or so in the apartments.  Close to a thousand employees are still working on campus, doing the critical hands-on work that can't be done remotely.  We could draw that down further if we absolutely had to, if Governor Reynolds issued a more stringent stay-at-home order, but doing so would have its own consequences.  Right now, we're where we need to be for the current public health imperatives.
 
On a day like this, our normal daytime population would be over 40,000.
 
Campus is... the word I cannot say, even here... and it shouldn't be.  The silence is unnatural.  This *isn't right*.

In time, we'll figure out what normal looks like after COVID-19.  But this is the part where we do all the work to get there, and it kinda sucks.",6,30,0.93,g6xgbq,,4/23/2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/g6xgbq/dispatches_from_the_eoc_the_q_word/,"Friley Windows,"

Post,"Hey all.

This semester is going to suck. I can't imagine being a student during this, and I'm so sorry it's happening to you. I wanted to just remind everyone that the university staff are basically gearing up to have the worst semester of their professional lives, and they are stressed. They will need to be caring and compassionate to students who need support, but (whether they admit it or not) they need care and compassion from you too.

I'm working from home during this, and I hear some of the conversations, the worried voices on my wife's department calls. Staff are terrified about their health, the health of students, their ability to work if schools have to close again. My wife isn't even supposed to be working, as she's on a 9-month contract. But sadly, she's currently spending 20-30hrs per week, unpaid, trying to unfuck her courses, go to department planning meetings, and answer student concerns when she originally intended to have the summer to bond with our newborn. There are hundreds, maybe thousands of other staff similarly sacrificing their summers without pay for the good of the students.

Be patient and kind to each other and ISU employees, and know that everyone wants to do their best.

Stay safe. Wear a mask. Go ISU.

In year four, Iowa State went 7-5, marking three consecutive winning seasons, a feat that has not been accomplished by Iowa State since 1976-1978.

Not only that, but yet another winning season meant four seasons in a row with a winning record, something not done by Iowa State since 1923-1927.

Post,"I am [Steve Butler](http://stevebutler.org) and am serving as the calculus coordinator this semester. Since about 10% of the students in any given semester are in a calculus class, I want to make sure that we start the semester understanding what is happening, and with some confidence in our ability to succeed.

The Canvas course shells for Math 165 (Basic calculus), Math 166 (Advanced calculus), and Math 265 (Multivariable calculus) should now be visible and ready to explore. There is a lot of information about how the course will run in Canvas and I encourage anyone in the class to take some time to get familiar with what is happening.

A few key points:

* The entire course, including quizzes and exams, is all online and there is no requirement to ever physically be somewhere.
* The course is set up to be highly flexible, for example the quizzes and exams do not have set times that they must be taken, but instead significant windows in which you can take them. You will be able to find a way to make it work with your schedule, regardless of where you are taking the course from.
* You can now access the online homework system. Before you do that you will need an online access code (which you can purchase; you do NOT have to purchase the physical copy of the book, the code can be purchased separately, and once you are into the homework system then you can get access to an electronic copy of the book). ***Most important thing: There is no course code for the homework. Instead once you go into the homework through Canvas it will automatically link you to the correct course.*** The first homework is already turned on, so you can try it out now if you want.

A significant amount of content for the course will be made publicly available on [http://calc1.org](http://calc1.org), [http://calc2.org](http://calc2.org), and [http://calc3.org](http://calc3.org); you can share this with your family so that they can also learn calculus along with you.

Post,"Hi everyone,

I'm assisting a friend in their search for a 1-bedroom, 1-bathroom apartment, and we're looking for recommendations that meet the following criteria:

\- Must have a washing machine and, ideally, a dishwasher.

\- Free heating in the winter is essential. The total rent, including all utilities (internet, water, etc.), should not exceed $900.

\- Proximity to public transit is a priority, ideally near lines 1, 2, or 3.

\- An included parking spot is a significant plus, and, if possible, a private garage would be great.

\- Good natural light is important (we prefer large windows).

Additionally, does anyone have tips on the best time to sign a lease to avoid high costs or unfavorable terms? Any advice on timing or general renting strategies would be greatly appreciated.

Comment,"A lot of people seem to think that ISU is acting like it's making money for shareholders or something. State schools are non-profit so its not like anyone is making a profit off owning it.

I'd guess that they have to make up money in places they have control over to offset that which they dont. The Iowa Legislature took away 4.5 million dollar from ISU (and Iowa I think) because they claimed they didnt have the budget for it. Not to mention the 4.5 million was taken back after it was given to ISU, so ISU was effectively in debt to the Legislature.

Its supposedly a zero sum game.

Most professors haven't gotten inflation raises for a while or other raises afaik. Additionally there have been a lot of new hires in departments that are growing quickly like Engineering, which doesnt help the budget (even though this is departmental, but the school as a whole kind of shares money but its complicated and has to do with research money etc.)

And there are other factors fo how funding works. Money donated to the school through private donors are required to be attached to a project or service. So when the football team got a donation for new helmets (not sure if that is a thing, but just as an example), that money couldn't be used for anything other than football equipment.

A lot of contracts for restaurants also ended, like Subway and Caribou. When the contract was done ISU dining decided it was cheaper to operate their own, that's why the MU is completely different and why the Hub is being renovated.

I agree the food isnt as good as it's used to, I especially miss Convos late night bundles. I am just trying to suggest possible reasons for why its happening.

I also agree it feels like a rip, especially since he required meal plans on campus.

I'd be more angry about how much spending is ultimately mishandled by people and if that is leading to monetary issues in the school.

Sorry for the long post, this is just some of the things I have heard from professors and other people who work as ISU.

Comment,"Seasons in the maple-willow-larch commons is a traditional dining hall and will have both pizza and pasta every day, though I think the pizza there sucks and the pasta is just ok. Conversations is a get and go place and will have wraps, but I have never had them. I remember them also having pizza a few nights. 

Your dorm likely won't provide food on days it is super cold/snowy and you'll have to go out. I would expect maybe a couple events a month in your dorm where you could get free food if you show up. My friends and I have gotten whole boxes of pizza showing up to events where very little people came. 

I think most people on the gold plan get by just fine. If you're super worried about not having enough food, you could get the cardinal plan. It's $150 more a semester but you will have unlimited meal swipes. You can go into a dining hall at any time they are open and grab a small snack and leave.

Comment,">Are you seriously doubting a college kids ability to get 2.6k calories with one all you can eat buffet every single day? 

In a healthy way, yes. The majority of healthy foods are not very calorie dense, so it's difficult, but not impossible to get enough calories in one meal when you're solely eating healthy. Think three large plates of food in one sitting. Is this something you've actually done yourself? I've eaten one meal per day before, and I either had to spend an annoying long time eating the meal, or I had to eat snacks during the day to lessen the meal beforehand.

>And I still can't grasp how you think that an all you can eat buffet twice a day is going to be 100% super healthy whereas any other meal someone eats at any other location is going to be super unhealthy. 

Stop putting words in my mouth. The other places you've been mentioning are fast food places, so that's what I was responding to. I think you need to read up on nutrition. The UDCC has lots of unhealthy options, but if you avoid those, it actually has lots of healthy options that would actually be somewhat expensive to buy yourself, including organic apples, blueberries, steak, etc.

I dunno, maybe you are short and don't need to eat much. Certainly if you lift weights and are active, it's normal to eat roughly 2.6k cal a day. And I don't see any cheaper way to do this than eat two large meals at the UDCC.

Comment,"I lived in Helser. Welcome to ISU!

Meal Plans - you have to have one. Get the smallest available, trust me you will probably have plenty and if not can buy more. There is a certain time frame to switch meal plans so keep an eye on that but start with the smallest. iirc meals expire at the semester and dining dollars expire at the year. Dining dollars buy you stuff in the convenience store and other places around campus so if you still have some left at the end of the semester you can buy non perishable foods or the non food items (staples and ibuprofen and stuff like that.)

The 2 main dining centers are in the UDCC (big building right there, can't miss it. you will also get mail and packages here). First is the one upstairs (Union Drive Marketplace) I was never much of an early riser so I didn't have breakfast often but a selection of donuts, eggs, pancakes, waffles (make your own any time of day), and other breakfasty stuff was all okay. They have different stations with different foods. you can check out the website to see whats one the menu for each of the different places. http://www.dining.iastate.edu/menus
In general I thought their food was run through a ""de-flavorizer"". The pizza can often be undercooked and they managed to ruin pancakes for me once. PANCAKES. thats some skill right there (or severe lack of) but for the most part it was a solid OK to MEH. They do have a soft serve ice cream/fro yo thing so beware the Freshman 15. 

Second up is Clyde's. I prefered to eat there. You can order online (idr the website, look for it when you walk in or ask) to avoid the line. Godfather's pizza and overall food quality is slightly better, if not the choice of a buffet. You get entree, drink, and 2? sides. Often I saved a side or two in my mini fridge for the days you don't want to leave the building for food and was still satisfied. 

When it comes down to it dorms and meal bundles are way expensive. I paid something like $7,000 or so my freshman year on just housing and food. Break down your meal bundle to the price per meal, its probably upwards of $6-7 a meal. That's almost restaurant prices. How many of those meals are spent on a single bowl of cereal? Right now I live in UV, and pay $2700 a year for apt with all utilities paid (dated and has its problems but by fair best price you can get in ames) except gas. I'm not great about marking exactly what I spend on what but I guarantee I haven't spent even close to $4300 on food. Hell I'd be surprised if it was greater than $1500. That's almost three grand in savings right there. I don't have to get dressed and leave my space if I want to go get food. I can eat on my hours, not only when dining center is open, and have what I want made how I like it. I have my own bedroom and we have a full kitchen and living room. We have a fenced in patio (abiet not huge). Dorms are great for your first year, but sophomore year you should definitely look into UV or other options. 

Sorry for the long post. I'l be happy to answer any questions

Comment,"This has been a problem for a couple years. I've stop eating at the west side dining areas completely. When I  lived on campus in 2018-19 the food at udcc was really good in the fall. Burgers, grilled cheese or chicken tenders at least 4-5 days a week. Suddenly the pizza became greasy dough with tomato water and whatever that gooey stuff on top it is. The foods I listed would maybe show up 2 times a week. And when they served it it would be gone by 1pm. I almost never eat before 2pm so I would pay for my meal walk in and see that the only things left were a halal hot dog and vegan tenders. As a picky eater It's not worth a swipe to go in to these dining centers only to find the only thing left that's appetizing is the cereal bar. This year I've been exclusively going to convos and the mu because of they don't have what I want I can leave before I waste money on something I don't want. If they stop the take out options after the pandemic then I probably won't get a meal plan again. It just feels like the quality goes down each semester but the price goes up.

There is a certain time frame to switch meal plans so keep an eye on that but start with the smallest. iirc meals expire at the semester and dining dollars expire at the year. Dining dollars buy you stuff in the convenience store and other places around campus so if you still have some left at the end of the semester you can buy non perishable foods or the non food items (staples and ibuprofen and stuff like that.)

The 2 main dining centers are in the UDCC (big building right there, can't miss it. you will also get mail and packages here). First is the one upstairs (Union Drive Marketplace) I was never much of an early riser so I didn't have breakfast often but a selection of donuts, eggs, pancakes, waffles (make your own any time of day), and other breakfasty stuff was all okay. They have different stations with different foods. you can check out the website to see whats one the menu for each of the different places. http://www.dining.iastate.edu/menus
In general I thought their food was run through a ""de-flavorizer"". The pizza can often be undercooked and they managed to ruin pancakes for me once. PANCAKES. thats some skill right there (or severe lack of) but for the most part it was a solid OK to MEH. They do have a soft serve ice cream/fro yo thing so beware the Freshman 15. 

Second up is Clyde's. I prefered to eat there. You can order online (idr the website, look for it when you walk in or ask) to avoid the line. Godfather's pizza and overall food quality is slightly better, if not the choice of a buffet. You get entree, drink, and 2? sides. Often I saved a side or two in my mini fridge for the days you don't want to leave the building for food and was still satisfied. 

When it comes down to it dorms and meal bundles are way expensive. I paid something like $7,000 or so my freshman year on just housing and food. Break down your meal bundle to the price per meal, its probably upwards of $6-7 a meal. That's almost restaurant prices. How many of those meals are spent on a single bowl of cereal? Right now I live in UV, and pay $2700 a year for apt with all utilities paid (dated and has its problems but by fair best price you can get in ames) except gas. I'm not great about marking exactly what I spend on what but I guarantee I haven't spent even close to $4300 on food. Hell I'd be surprised if it was greater than $1500. That's almost three grand in savings right there. I don't have to get dressed and leave my space if I want to go get food. I can eat on my hours, not only when dining center is open, and have what I want made how I like it. I have my own bedroom and we have a full kitchen and living room. We have a fenced in patio (abiet not huge). Dorms are great for your first year, but sophomore year you should definitely look into UV or other options. 

Sorry for the long post. I'l be happy to answer any questions

**TL:DR** MEH, go to clyde's, expensive go UV instead sophomore year.",2,7,,4csd5v,t3_4csd5v,3/31/2016,/r/iastate/comments/4csd5v/how_are_foods_from_isu_dining_hall/d1lcywn/,"Union Drive Community Center,"

Comment,"Going to the HyVee from Friley takes 11 minutes on the bus. After one trip you can get all the snacks you need for a month.

>And your advice is to eat two or three times a day at an all you can eat buffet! That's not going to be healthy or cost effective. 
You've been advocating snacking on fast food, pizza, chips, pop, all things that at are terrible for your health.
The UDCC's food is very healthy, provided you eat the right things.

I had club meetings, study sessions, parties, etc. that I went to as a freshman, the thing you do is simply plan ahead and eat your meals around them, because (as I have been saying) the amount of food you get from those engagements is never very substantial. If you have too many meals, you can get a to go meal and store it for later.

So the more meals you get per week, the smaller the meal will be, but the cheaper it will also be. So 14 meals would be fine, because you could store any extra meals in your fridge. Therefore no need for extra snack food.

>There is nothing more expensive than an unused meal swipe. 

Not buying enough, and having to buy more at a greater price is more expensive. Eating lots of fast food and getting heart disease is even more expensive.",0,0,,4csd5v,t1_d1lejh9,4/1/2016,/r/iastate/comments/4csd5v/how_are_foods_from_isu_dining_hall/d1lgbb4/,"Union Drive Community Center,"

Comment,">Some kid is going to waste thousands of dollars because of your terrible advice. 

Dude, I'm the one saying to buy cheap groceries rather than use dining dollars to buy snacks. You're advice is to buy more dining dollars, which costs more.

>There's a ton more that goes into grocery shopping when you live in a dorm

The only difficult thing is getting a fridge in your apartment, but that's not even hard. How is buying apples, nuts, yogurt and eating them so hard?

>Jimmy Johns and having it delivered to you

again, fast food is bad for you. Jimmy Johns has a lot of bread and processed meat. Also, I thought you liked variety, and that was one reason you hated the UDCC? Jimmy Johns is not that much cheaper than a meal at the UDCC, either. (going on the $7.43 meal).

You may not be aware of this, but the first advise financially struggling people often get is to not buy fast food. Fast food is usually much more expensive than buying groceries and cooking yourself, contrary to what you would think.

I last lived on campus in 2020 so this may be changing but Conversations (convos) is in the basement of oak/elm and is get and go only. Their menu is mostly chicken tenders, fries, burgers etc. 

The big dining center on east side is Seasons in the middle of Maple Willow Larch. Menu is on a 2-3week rotation. Dining center food is amazing first semester for freshman then you get sick of it. Seasons has a ton of options. I miss the weekend brunch menu. 

If it's cold you have to tough it out and go somewhere. I always stashed snacks and microwave meals in my room. Dorms dont cater to students buildings in the cold. Your meal plan depends on how much you plan on eating. I always had classes through lunch so I had a ton of swipes leftover.

Comment,"A lot of people seem to think that ISU is acting like it's making money for shareholders or something. State schools are non-profit so its not like anyone is making a profit off owning it.

I'd guess that they have to make up money in places they have control over to offset that which they dont. The Iowa Legislature took away 4.5 million dollar from ISU (and Iowa I think) because they claimed they didnt have the budget for it. Not to mention the 4.5 million was taken back after it was given to ISU, so ISU was effectively in debt to the Legislature.

Its supposedly a zero sum game.

Most professors haven't gotten inflation raises for a while or other raises afaik. Additionally there have been a lot of new hires in departments that are growing quickly like Engineering, which doesnt help the budget (even though this is departmental, but the school as a whole kind of shares money but its complicated and has to do with research money etc.)

And there are other factors fo how funding works. Money donated to the school through private donors are required to be attached to a project or service. So when the football team got a donation for new helmets (not sure if that is a thing, but just as an example), that money couldn't be used for anything other than football equipment.

A lot of contracts for restaurants also ended, like Subway and Caribou. When the contract was done ISU dining decided it was cheaper to operate their own, that's why the MU is completely different and why the Hub is being renovated.

I agree the food isnt as good as it's used to, I especially miss Convos late night bundles. I am just trying to suggest possible reasons for why its happening.

I also agree it feels like a rip, especially since he required meal plans on campus.

I'd be more angry about how much spending is ultimately mishandled by people and if that is leading to monetary issues in the school.

Sorry for the long post, this is just some of the things I have heard from professors and other people who work as ISU.

Comment,"Seasons in the maple-willow-larch commons is a traditional dining hall and will have both pizza and pasta every day, though I think the pizza there sucks and the pasta is just ok. Conversations is a get and go place and will have wraps, but I have never had them. I remember them also having pizza a few nights. 

Your dorm likely won't provide food on days it is super cold/snowy and you'll have to go out. I would expect maybe a couple events a month in your dorm where you could get free food if you show up. My friends and I have gotten whole boxes of pizza showing up to events where very little people came. 

I think most people on the gold plan get by just fine. If you're super worried about not having enough food, you could get the cardinal plan. It's $150 more a semester but you will have unlimited meal swipes. You can go into a dining hall at any time they are open and grab a small snack and leave. It really just comes down to your eating habits.",0,7,,1e8bwtq,t3_1e8bwtq,7/20/2024,/r/iastate/comments/1e8bwtq/lyon_and_dining_halls/le69ctc/,"Seasons Marketplace,Conversations Dining,"

Comment,"Try Powermilk today - the power drink for the whole family! Powermilk is made from the finest Powerade and chocolate milk ISU dining has to offer. One sip of Powermilk will get you the power you need to get through the toughest challenge.

Don't believe me? The first time I tried Powermilk, and I was able scale the Campanile, take a Calc III exam remotely and grab a goose as it flew by, all before jumping down in front of a group of touring students. The man leading the group slowly turned, gave a little chuckle, and said ""That's a lot of power!"" I looked up past his bushy beard and saw that it was Steve Butler himself! He instantly gave me an A in not only Calc III, but in all the previous Calculus classes I had ever taken. Feeling powerful, I let go of the goose and galloped back to Friley Windows for another sip. 

After trying Powermilk, you will never need any other form of sustenance. That's the Powermilk Promise!

Powermilk currently comes in two irresistible flavors - Blue-brown and Red-brown. They both taste as good as they sound, so grab a glass today!",2,97,,jw0pd0,t3_jw0pd0,11/17/2020,/r/iastate/comments/jw0pd0/i_fear_you/gcnifes/,"Friley Windows,"
Comment,"I lived in Helser. Welcome to ISU!

Meal Plans - you have to have one. Get the smallest available, trust me you will probably have plenty and if not can buy more. There is a certain time frame to switch meal plans so keep an eye on that but start with the smallest. iirc meals expire at the semester and dining dollars expire at the year. Dining dollars buy you stuff in the convenience store and other places around campus so if you still have some left at the end of the semester you can buy non perishable foods or the non food items (staples and ibuprofen and stuff like that.)

The 2 main dining centers are in the UDCC (big building right there, can't miss it. you will also get mail and packages here). First is the one upstairs (Union Drive Marketplace) I was never much of an early riser so I didn't have breakfast often but a selection of donuts, eggs, pancakes, waffles (make your own any time of day), and other breakfasty stuff was all okay. They have different stations with different foods. you can check out the website to see whats one the menu for each of the different places. http://www.dining.iastate.edu/menus
In general I thought their food was run through a ""de-flavorizer"". The pizza can often be undercooked and they managed to ruin pancakes for me once. PANCAKES. thats some skill right there (or severe lack of) but for the most part it was a solid OK to MEH. They do have a soft serve ice cream/fro yo thing so beware the Freshman 15. 

Second up is Clyde's. I prefered to eat there. You can order online (idr the website, look for it when you walk in or ask) to avoid the line. Godfather's pizza and overall food quality is slightly better, if not the choice of a buffet. You get entree, drink, and 2? sides. Often I saved a side or two in my mini fridge for the days you don't want to leave the building for food and was still satisfied. 

When it comes down to it dorms and meal bundles are way expensive. I paid something like $7,000 or so my freshman year on just housing and food. Break down your meal bundle to the price per meal, its probably upwards of $6-7 a meal. That's almost restaurant prices. How many of those meals are spent on a single bowl of cereal? Right now I live in UV, and pay $2700 a year for apt with all utilities paid (dated and has its problems but by fair best price you can get in ames) except gas. I'm not great about marking exactly what I spend on what but I guarantee I haven't spent even close to $4300 on food. Hell I'd be surprised if it was greater than $1500. That's almost three grand in savings right there. I don't have to get dressed and leave my space if I want to go get food. I can eat on my hours, not only when dining center is open, and have what I want made how I like it. I have my own bedroom and we have a full kitchen and living room. We have a fenced in patio (abiet not huge). Dorms are great for your first year, but sophomore year you should definitely look into UV or other options. 

Sorry for the long post. I'l be happy to answer any questions
