Post,"In light of recent posts, I wanted to share a classic gem from my experiences at Seasons last year. So there I am, sitting at the table facing the drink machines against the right wall as you walk in, and this student walks up to the cup rack. He grabs a cup from wide variety of options and proceeds to pour water into said cup. To this day, I have no idea what was going through this kid's head, but the mf whole ass *tosses the cup in the air* trying to flip it and catch it, but instead, he fails to grab hold after it comes back down and water goes fucking everywhere. To say I was struggling to retain my laughter would be an understatement. He proceeded to grab napkins, but the damage was done—whoever you are, I won't forget the day I watched you try and flip and catch a cup of water in Seasons for absolutely no fucking reason",3,48,0.96,jw7lnl,,11/17/2020,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/jw7lnl/tales_from_the_dining_hall/,"Seasons Marketplace,"
Post,"I was eating at a table in UDCC as I usually do and a freshman (presumably) girl said ""is anyone sitting here?"" and then sat across from me.

This is wrong on several levels. First off, please spare me the question. I'm eating and don't want to talk with my mouth full. You and I can both see that no one is sitting there.

And second, have the decency to maximize the space between us. At least leave one seat. There is no need to be directly across from me. 

And then she glanced up at me several times after she sat down. Let me eat in privacy. I was so disgusted that I left without finishing my food.

Post,"I see that we have a few dining halls close to Lyon (my dorm), Conversations, one at MU and another Get and Go east side.

I have enrolled into the Gold plan. Do I have access to all of these 3 places above? Is the food pretty ok at these location - do they have pizzas/pasta/wraps?

When it is super cold / snowing heavily outside, is there a limited food option within Lyon itself or do we have to go out to one of these 3 places? 

  
Finally, if you are a guy who likes pizzas/food, is the gold plan adequate to fill you up or are you going to have to hit the candy machines a couple hours after lunch?

Post,"Over the past 2 years of living in the Res halls, I have had nothing but bad experiences at Windows.

I get that it isn't a large dining hall, but the quality of the food isn't what it should be for a 2 year old dining hall. 

Windows has had major issues with:
-Serving raw or undercooked meat
-Incorrectly labeling food 
-Incorrectly or not listing allergens

Some other issues that are not as bad:
-Late night food is nothing but pizza and salad most of the time (problem for people with allergies) 
-Allergen free options are awful and mainly just vegan options

Compared to seasons, UDCC, and even Storms, it's sad to see a new dining center just not on par with any other dining center.

Post,"Four years ago convos had espresso machines, there were 3 sides per meal bundle, there were no such things as “flex” meals, a meal swipe was a meal swipe. 

The next year they removed the espresso machines from convos, made meal bundles jump down to 2 sides per meal.

The next year they introduced flex meals - 35 per semester and the unlimited plans, while raising the prices of all the meal plans.

This year they lowered the amount of express meals, removed caribou, destroyed froots selection and renaming it “whirlybirds”, and lowered the amount of flex meals yet again, while introducing a cyflex plan for those who relied on flex meals.

Meal plans were pretty simple, a swipe was a swipe anywhere.  If you wanted to buy something that was a bundle, you'd use your dining dollars.

Now there's a lot of confusion, swiping in a friend subtracts from your dining dollars, limited flex meals, less amounts of food from bundles, and more.

So how does ISU lose money from this?  There are many meals that are left over from the fold plans at end of semesters.

Post,"Freshman here. As per the DOR, we do not need to empty out our rooms during winter, so I'd assume there are no additional room charges for staying on during the winter break.

I guess that the campus empties out and it is pretty lonely and bleak during the winter break. For folks who do stay back, how do you get to dining halls in the snow, if at all they stay open. If not, do we just have to grab a bite at Convos? where else can we get a bite on campus? Do we just use our dining dollars?

Also, what do you do to stay sane when the campus empties out? Not that the campus is hopping currently.

Post,"Here's a starter list

• Downtown Ames for cute local businesses, restaurants, the farmers market, well established bars, public art, Octagon Arts Center, and even the really nice library

• Campustown for student centered nightlife, dive bars, local businesses and restaurants. Clouds is an awesome coffee shop on the top level of Legacy Tower with great views of campus

• Somerset for a nice place to walk. It was intended to be another downtown environment, but most businesses are just financial services or clinics. However, The Cafe, Wallaby's, Brick Town, and El Azteca are all successful local restaurants worth visiting

• Campus is a great place to walk, see interesting architecture, find lots of public art funded by the Iowa Public Art For Public Buildings initiative, go to 3 great museums,, watch wildlife at Lake Laverne, go to live music events at the Memorial Union, go to college sports events, and enjoy the beauty of the four seasons, especially in April and October 

• Reiman Gardens for the indoor tropical butterfly enclosure, conservatory- especially during winter, the wonderful 12 or so different gardens with noticeable changes throughout the year, awesome events for Christmas and Halloween, and excellent rotating sculpture displays 

• Throughout town is a great bike trail system, part of the central Iowa trails. The trails connect most parts of the town and its parks system, which is also worth visiting for places like Ada Hayden Lake, Tedesco Environmental Learning Corridor, Moore Memorial Park, North River Valley Park at the whitewater rapids, and Inis Grove Park 

• Story County has lots of hiking trails, especially along the Skunk River Greenbelt. McFarland Park is quite nice, even found a natural 4' waterfall there. Most are managed by Story County Conservation, but even in Ames, public land for hiking can be found at Pammel Woods, Munn Woods, and Reactor Woods. Please treat these areas well if you go

• Lockwood Cafe and Reliable St are totally a hidden gem, with tons of artwork and cool graffiti on all sides of the building inside and out, an indoor skate ramp upstairs at WeCycle, great events like open mic night, outdoor movie showings, and they even had a passenger rail event to Boone. The surrounding grounds also have a small children's garden, really unique wooden play feature designed by architecture students, free community garden on a first come first serve basis, and free thrift store",10,75,1,1b5g6q6,,3/3/2024,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/1b5g6q6/things_to_do_and_hidden_gems_in_ames/,"Seasons Marketplace,"

Post,"Hi ISU community,

I'm an alumni (class of 2023) and I used to work in Convos from 2020-2021. I remember that they used to make this creamy potato soup with bacon bits in it, and every time that soup was available, I'd get it with my free meal. I am now far away from ISU and I specifically miss this soup, and I never got the recipe since the guy making it was very light lipped about it. Does anyone know the recipe for this soup or have found a recipe similar to the one from Convos? As we are now in soup season, I'd love to make it for myself.

Post,"I was skeptical at first yet it exceeded my expectations. Shoutout all the homies at Seasons who worked their asses off. 

Presentation: I was pleasantly surprised when I saw my spread of wonderful Thanksgiving classics. Turkey - decent portion size, lean and carved right in front of you at Wood Grill. Carrots - seasoned well but lacking some major roasting. Yukon mashed potatoes - basic. Gravy - wasn't very promising. Cranberry Relish - cute little portion size, typical. Pumpkin pie - perfect amount of whipped cream, looked great! Cornbread ”dressing“ - It‘s called stuffing but ok...looked unreasonably moist. Powermilk - ok I‘m just messing around. 

Flavor & Texture: This is obviously the most important category. I was both satisfied and disappointed. Let's start with some sides. Cranberry Relish - good flavor but you know it comes from a can. Carrots - disappointing, very soft and sweet yet cold and flavorless. Cornbread dressing - So good. I actually really enjoyed the classic stuffing flavor and texture was just right! Now for the bulk of the meal...Yukon mashed potatoes - quite natural taste, barely any seasoning but that's what gravy is for. Gravy - tasteful, warm, scrumptious. Turkey - lean and tasty, quite dry but then again gravy. Pumpkin pie - delicious, and accompanied my meal perfectly. 

I can honestly say I was fulfilled with this meal. It really shocked me how well Seasons and presumably the other dining halls did with this. As I walked past the overflowing dish line, praying for my poor coworkers, I reflected on my meal and smiled a little with a sense of nostalgia and happiness that I got to have a somewhat normal Thanksgiving.

Post,"I live in SUV and been buying a mix of meal blocks and some dining dollars for the past few semesters which worked perfectly for a random lunch on campus and a few things from the C-Store here and there, but then started to really think about it. 



When using a meal for Froots, Hawthorne or Clyde's, you're actually loosing money every time. I used to buy a 50 meal block, which was roughly $10.50 a meal, but a typical bundle at Clyde's or Hawthorne is like $8-$9, so you're losing ~$2 every meal you use. When using a bundle for Froots, you're spending $10.50 on a $6 smoothie, losing even more. The only instance where you're not losing money would be at Seasons/UDCC/Conversations where a meal cost $11 but if you buy enough Dining Dollars, you get a discount though, so even that evens out for the same cost.



So overall, you're going to save money on pretty much any meal bundle you use, have more freedom for your meals (Don't have to get 2 sides or can get whatever you want from the C-Store for a ""side"" instead for pretty much same price), and have the ability to use those extra dining dollars on whatever the hell you want.




In this post I use estimates, but I actually spent some time going through the actual numbers comparing a 50 meal block to equivalent dining dollars and the math checks out. This might not be true for the 25 meal blocks, but it should be even if anything. Also, the prices for blocks/DD can change so this might not be true for future years. Double check the math if you're hesitant and you should come to the same conclusion, just trying to help people out with this advice.",7,44,0.98,5797mz,,10/13/2016,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/5797mz/for_those_of_you_buying_meal_blocks_dont_buy/,"Union Drive Community Center,Seasons Marketplace,Conversations Dining,"

Your dorm likely won't provide food on days it is super cold/snowy and you'll have to go out. I would expect maybe a couple events a month in your dorm where you could get free food if you show up. My friends and I have gotten whole boxes of pizza showing up to events where very little people came. 

I think most people on the gold plan get by just fine. If you're super worried about not having enough food, you could get the cardinal plan.

Comment,">Are you seriously doubting a college kids ability to get 2.6k calories with one all you can eat buffet every single day? 

In a healthy way, yes. The majority of healthy foods are not very calorie dense, so it's difficult, but not impossible to get enough calories in one meal when you're solely eating healthy. Think three large plates of food in one sitting. Is this something you've actually done yourself? I've eaten one meal per day before, and I either had to spend an annoying long time eating the meal, or I had to eat snacks during the day to lessen the meal beforehand.

>And I still can't grasp how you think that an all you can eat buffet twice a day is going to be 100% super healthy whereas any other meal someone eats at any other location is going to be super unhealthy. 

Stop putting words in my mouth. The other places you've been mentioning are fast food places, so that's what I was responding to. I think you need to read up on nutrition. The UDCC has lots of unhealthy options, but if you avoid those, it actually has lots of healthy options that would actually be somewhat expensive to buy yourself, including organic apples, blueberries, steak, etc.

I dunno, maybe you are short and don't need to eat much. Certainly if you lift weights and are active, it's normal to eat roughly 2.6k cal a day. And I don't see any cheaper way to do this than eat two large meals at the UDCC.

>And your advice is to eat two or three times a day at an all you can eat buffet! That's not going to be healthy or cost effective. 
You've been advocating snacking on fast food, pizza, chips, pop, all things that at are terrible for your health.
The UDCC's food is very healthy, provided you eat the right things.

I had club meetings, study sessions, parties, etc. that I went to as a freshman, the thing you do is simply plan ahead and eat your meals around them, because (as I have been saying) the amount of food you get from those engagements is never very substantial. If you have too many meals, you can get a to go meal and store it for later.

So the more meals you get per week, the smaller the meal will be, but the cheaper it will also be. So 14 meals would be fine, because you could store any extra meals in your fridge. Therefore no need for extra snack food.

>There is nothing more expensive than an unused meal swipe.

Comment,"The MU one is a food court with various choices ranging from pateries to salads to pizza to chicken etc. If i remember correctly it closes earlier than dining centers and was rarely open on weekends. Panda Express in the mu is open later but very limited hours on weekends. 

I last lived on campus in 2020 so this may be changing but Conversations (convos) is in the basement of oak/elm and is get and go only. Their menu is mostly chicken tenders, fries, burgers etc. 

The big dining center on east side is Seasons in the middle of Maple Willow Larch. Menu is on a 2-3week rotation. Dining center food is amazing first semester for freshman then you get sick of it. Seasons has a ton of options. I miss the weekend brunch menu. 

If it's cold you have to tough it out and go somewhere. I always stashed snacks and microwave meals in my room. Dorms dont cater to students buildings in the cold.

Comment,"A lot of people seem to think that ISU is acting like it's making money for shareholders or something. State schools are non-profit so its not like anyone is making a profit off owning it.

I'd guess that they have to make up money in places they have control over to offset that which they dont. The Iowa Legislature took away 4.5 million dollar from ISU (and Iowa I think) because they claimed they didnt have the budget for it. Not to mention the 4.5 million was taken back after it was given to ISU, so ISU was effectively in debt to the Legislature.

Its supposedly a zero sum game.

Most professors haven't gotten inflation raises for a while or other raises afaik. Additionally there have been a lot of new hires in departments that are growing quickly like Engineering, which doesnt help the budget (even though this is departmental, but the school as a whole kind of shares money but its complicated and has to do with research money etc.)

And there are other factors fo how funding works. Money donated to the school through private donors are required to be attached to a project or service. So when the football team got a donation for new helmets (not sure if that is a thing, but just as an example), that money couldn't be used for anything other than football equipment.

A lot of contracts for restaurants also ended, like Subway and Caribou. When the contract was done ISU dining decided it was cheaper to operate their own, that's why the MU is completely different and why the Hub is being renovated.

I agree the food isnt as good as it's used to, I especially miss Convos late night bundles. I am just trying to suggest possible reasons for why its happening.

I also agree it feels like a rip, especially since he required meal plans on campus.

I'd be more angry about how much spending is ultimately mishandled by people and if that is leading to monetary issues in the school.

Sorry for the long post, this is just some of the things I have heard from professors and other people who work as ISU.

There is a certain time frame to switch meal plans so keep an eye on that but start with the smallest. iirc meals expire at the semester and dining dollars expire at the year. Dining dollars buy you stuff in the convenience store and other places around campus so if you still have some left at the end of the semester you can buy non perishable foods or the non food items (staples and ibuprofen and stuff like that.)

The 2 main dining centers are in the UDCC (big building right there, can't miss it. you will also get mail and packages here). First is the one upstairs (Union Drive Marketplace) I was never much of an early riser so I didn't have breakfast often but a selection of donuts, eggs, pancakes, waffles (make your own any time of day), and other breakfasty stuff was all okay. They have different stations with different foods. you can check out the website to see whats one the menu for each of the different places. http://www.dining.iastate.edu/menus
In general I thought their food was run through a ""de-flavorizer"". The pizza can often be undercooked and they managed to ruin pancakes for me once. PANCAKES. thats some skill right there (or severe lack of) but for the most part it was a solid OK to MEH. They do have a soft serve ice cream/fro yo thing so beware the Freshman 15. 

Second up is Clyde's. I prefered to eat there. You can order online (idr the website, look for it when you walk in or ask) to avoid the line. Godfather's pizza and overall food quality is slightly better, if not the choice of a buffet. You get entree, drink, and 2? sides. Often I saved a side or two in my mini fridge for the days you don't want to leave the building for food and was still satisfied. 

When it comes down to it dorms and meal bundles are way expensive. I paid something like $7,000 or so my freshman year on just housing and food. Break down your meal bundle to the price per meal, its probably upwards of $6-7 a meal. That's almost restaurant prices. How many of those meals are spent on a single bowl of cereal? Right now I live in UV, and pay $2700 a year for apt with all utilities paid (dated and has its problems but by fair best price you can get in ames) except gas. I'm not great about marking exactly what I spend on what but I guarantee I haven't spent even close to $4300 on food. Hell I'd be surprised if it was greater than $1500. That's almost three grand in savings right there. I don't have to get dressed and leave my space if I want to go get food. I can eat on my hours, not only when dining center is open, and have what I want made how I like it. I have my own bedroom and we have a full kitchen and living room. We have a fenced in patio (abiet not huge). Dorms are great for your first year, but sophomore year you should definitely look into UV or other options. 

Sorry for the long post. I'l be happy to answer any questions

**TL:DR** MEH, go to clyde's, expensive go UV instead sophomore year.",2,6,,4csd5v,t3_4csd5v,3/31/2016,/r/iastate/comments/4csd5v/how_are_foods_from_isu_dining_hall/d1lcywn/,"Union Drive Community Center,"

Windows is great because it means that if I'm hungry at 12 I don't have wait an hour till the rush dies, I don't have to go the other side of campus to get food. I can just go to Windows or udcc and I have been able to find seating at both within about 5 minutes tops.

Last year there were multiple times when I walked around udcc looking for seating for literally 15 minutes.

Comment,"Dining student from windows - 

I can say for sure that everyone is frustrated with it, including the cooks and students, but many apologies. I believe one part of it is the pandemic making supply and demand difficult (can confirm that seasons is also struggling, wish we could help).

But for us specifically, we lost important employees right before and as the pandemic began. One of our two managers is working down at Storms with some sort of team for management during the pandemic (temporarily), and our head cook retired this year. Its difficult to count numbers when understaffed, and the cooks we have are trying their best with the time they have (cant go over a certain amount of hours, university policy i believe).

I cant say anything for any other dining centers, but at windows we are trying our best with what help we've got.

Comment,">Some kid is going to waste thousands of dollars because of your terrible advice. 

Dude, I'm the one saying to buy cheap groceries rather than use dining dollars to buy snacks. You're advice is to buy more dining dollars, which costs more.

>There's a ton more that goes into grocery shopping when you live in a dorm

The only difficult thing is getting a fridge in your apartment, but that's not even hard. How is buying apples, nuts, yogurt and eating them so hard?

>Jimmy Johns and having it delivered to you

again, fast food is bad for you. Jimmy Johns has a lot of bread and processed meat. Also, I thought you liked variety, and that was one reason you hated the UDCC? Jimmy Johns is not that much cheaper than a meal at the UDCC, either. (going on the $7.43 meal).

You may not be aware of this, but the first advise financially struggling people often get is to not buy fast food. Fast food is usually much more expensive than buying groceries and cooking yourself, contrary to what you would think. (not to mention the lack of nutrition)",1,2,,4csd5v,t1_d1ldjya,3/31/2016,/r/iastate/comments/4csd5v/how_are_foods_from_isu_dining_hall/d1leet6/,"Union Drive Community Center,"

Comment,">Man you are like the world's biggest college dining center fan. 

I'm just opposed to your idea that getting more dining dollars is a good idea, if I understand you correctly. And I don't think 1 UDCC meal per day is advisable for the general freshman body, at least in the certain terms that you state it.

> I never met one person in Friley or MWL or anywhere that got too few meals and complained about not having enough swipes.

It was their decision to get that many meals. They're probably just replacing their meal with snacks, pizza, beer, coffee etc.",1,1,,4csd5v,t1_d1lcqoi,3/31/2016,/r/iastate/comments/4csd5v/how_are_foods_from_isu_dining_hall/d1ldx9d/,"Union Drive Community Center,"

Comment,"This has been a problem for a couple years. I've stop eating at the west side dining areas completely. When I  lived on campus in 2018-19 the food at udcc was really good in the fall. Burgers, grilled cheese or chicken tenders at least 4-5 days a week. Suddenly the pizza became greasy dough with tomato water and whatever that gooey stuff on top it is. The foods I listed would maybe show up 2 times a week. And when they served it it would be gone by 1pm. I almost never eat before 2pm so I would pay for my meal walk in and see that the only things left were a halal hot dog and vegan tenders. As a picky eater It's not worth a swipe to go in to these dining centers only to find the only thing left that's appetizing is the cereal bar. This year I've been exclusively going to convos and the mu because of they don't have what I want I can leave before I waste money on something I don't want. If they stop the take out options after the pandemic then I probably won't get a meal plan again. It just feels like the quality goes down each semester but the price goes up.
