6,Comment,"It's not just $33/month increase. Insurance is essentially ""free"" at the moment (One of the options at least, if not free at a 'reasonable' rate). A $3,000 deductible is being added. So it is something to be very angry at given the utter lack of yearly salary raises. It is essentially a pay cut. As this writeup states, the university often touts its great benefits to offset its 'lack of ability' to pay higher wages. Without those great benefits, what motivation does high performing and committed staff and faculty have to stay?",2,11,,16pdqlv,t1_k1r1ox8,/r/iastate/comments/16pdqlv/staff_needs_your_help/k1rfw3p/

When the ‚Äúturn on‚Äù the power plant it is extremely expensive to ‚Äúturn it off‚Äù. Shutting down the steam heating system/ ramping down the power plant is expensive so when they turn it on for the winter season, it‚Äôs staying on until April/whenever it is warm for a long time. The heat controls in the dorms and buildings are ass. It‚Äôs an old system but it‚Äôs cheap. The steam makes the temperature regulation in the dorms impossible.

22,Post,"This has more to do with residence halls. Most of my classes will end up at Carver for my major so it would be nice to be near there. I know the closest residence halls are Helser Eaten Friley etc, but I am more looking for a dorm that everyone doesn't have a stick up there ass and still parties. Seems weird for a math major to be a party person but yeah it happens. Are any of those dorms near Carver party dorms, and if not is MWL area to far away on bike ride to get to Carver with in reason? Also for anyone who took a bike up there before is it impossible to ride them around in the winter? Which of the two neighborhoods is close to one of the better dining centers? Also the fuck is Wilson doing so far out? Just as a reference my entire knowledge of the campus comes from the online map.

39,Comment,"I have two programming languages that I use:

1. Python
2. Graduate student

To be fair I primarily use Python; I only resort to Graduate student for the really intense computations.

In some sense, the way that I think tends to be very algorithmic and procedural and so programming usually is very straightforward. And I do a fair bit of programming, probably at least once a week I write some code to do some simple explorations of a mathematical nature. But once or twice a year I tackle an over-sized problem that at face value should take forever to run the computation. I like to think about different ways to approach running a computation and have been able to come up with some fairly clever routines of which I am quite proud (though they do not have any practical application outside of the computations that I run).",0,8,,i6qqq0,t1_g0ye4ep,/r/iastate/comments/i6qqq0/ama_with_the_calculus_coordinator_steve_butler/g0yf9ir/

41,Comment,"I've worked for people who *didn't* lead by example and who were openly contemptuous of the ""little people"" in their org charts.  It's a refreshing change to not be in that situation.

Part of leading from the front is sharing the risks (whether actual or perceived).  From a resource management perspective, it's not the best decision.  You want your leadership relatively removed from both personal threat and the hands-on operational churn so they can focus on strategic decision-making and situational awareness.  However, from a morale perspective, it's priceless.

My criticism, in this case, is reserved for the groups who are screaming at us to do things but who won't actually step up to help us staff those efforts when I've repeatedly begged them for help.  (I actually did say ""I'm begging you for help"" on a call last week.)

59,Comment,"So on that timetable that I linked to you, those are all called timepoints. If you were to follow the route along the map starting over on the east end, you'll see little square marks throughout the map. 

https://www.cyride.com/maps/school-year-maps/individual-pdf-maps/9-plum-map

Each of those square marks is a timepoint, which is what you're looking for on the timetable. This is what time the buses depart from the stop, so make sure she's there about 1-2 minutes early so she doesn't miss it.

For example, the second timepoint on the timetables that I gave you is S.16th and S. Grand - that is the stop in front of the Grove (or across the street from the Quarters.) The bus leaves that stop at 6:58am, 7:18am, 7:38am, etc. Those are the times that she would want to be at the stop to board it.

You can see other timepoints like Kildee Hall and Friley Hall - say she is boarding over near the Design college, she would want to use the Kildee timepoint and add about a minute. 

So to answer your question, yes you use the same timetable, and that will give you all of the times that the bus will depart each timepoint. Since it goes in a loop, if you follow the first row of timepoints, you'll notice that the first trip leaves Buckeye at 6:55am and returns around 7:27am.",1,4,,15qvdii,t1_jwfio21,/r/iastate/comments/15qvdii/cyride_fall_2023_update_welcome_and_welcome_back/jwfmg63/

I last lived on campus in 2020 so this may be changing but Conversations (convos) is in the basement of oak/elm and is get and go only. Their menu is mostly chicken tenders, fries, burgers etc. 

The big dining center on east side is Seasons in the middle of Maple Willow Larch. Menu is on a 2-3week rotation. Dining center food is amazing first semester for freshman then you get sick of it. Seasons has a ton of options. I miss the weekend brunch menu. 

If it‚Äôs cold you have to tough it out and go somewhere. I always stashed snacks and microwave meals in my room. Dorms dont cater to students buildings in the cold.

99,Post,"Housing students has been a frequent problem for the university since it opened in 1868, and it was certainly true during the World War I era. After World War I, enrollment boomed at Iowa State -- nearly doubling between 1917 (2,091 students) and 1922 (4,008 students). During and immediately following the war, Lyon, Freeman, and Barton Halls were built as well as the temporary Oak-Elm Lodges (replaced by current Oak and Elm Halls in 1937). The college also bought some nearby cottages in the early 1920s in attempts to ease the housing shortage. Ames proper and Campustown had housing for students (and the streetcar service for transportation) but even they struggled to keep up with demand. There was a time when freshmen might not have housing when they arrived for registration and would sleep on cots in hallways or even in the city parks with their luggage for a number of nights. University administrators were even housing students until they could find a permanent residence.

By 1922-23, when the college created a report for the Iowa Legislature, basements in campus housing had been converted to residential space despite the lack of closets, real beds, and walls to create separate rooms. Cheap temporary buildings constructed during the war were still in use but far beyond capacity. More than one class might be held in a building that lacked any walls and many offices also served as classrooms -- private meetings between teachers and students were not possible in numerous buildings. Even the largest classrooms were too small since many departments' enrollments -- especially home economics and various agricultural programs -- ballooned after the war. Some classes met in hallways and corridors because of the lack of actual classroom space. Locker rooms designed for 25 people were being used by more than 100 and janitor spaces were moved to attics and nooks to make room for more student space. By today's rules and laws, several fire codes were being broken.

The report to the legislature was for more money to build new structures for offices and classrooms. By the end of the decade, buildings that were constructed (and still stand today) include McKay Hall, Food Sciences Building, and Sweeney Hall. Enrollment had also begun to level off and remained fairly steady until the mid 1930s.

The same year the report was written, Birch Hall was being constructed and, over the next few years, would be followed by Hughes (now the south part of Friley) and Welch Halls and the [International House](http://www.amespubliclibrary.org/farwell/publication/Pub9617.htm), which was located on the now-empty lot across from Buchanan (and where the upcoming residence hall will stand).

106,Comment,"In the last 5 years, Customer Service in IT Services was slowly bled, then butchered, and then consumed by the other units in ITS by a slow attrition of talent and internal political infighting. I can't say I know everything or I have the timeline exactly right, but this is the best reconstruction I can manage.

5 years ago, Customer Service inside IT Services was getting weaker and then lost it‚Äôs leadership when the director Cheryl Langston got sick, got better, and then retired in ‚Äô13. This position was never filled by either a promotion or new hire. As much as I like Frank & Cory, they never were able to cultivate the political strength they needed after Ms. Langston moved on. They were placed under a senior manager, Mike Lohrbach, who‚Äôs emphasis was either indifferent or banally mismanaged to end-user support. Mike‚Äôs real strength is managing campus domain operations & development. Mike‚Äôs former supervisor, Angela Bradley, was blandly hostile to Customer Service and wasn‚Äôt willing to support the Solution Center (Angela incidentally has left following another political reshuffling and her exile to career siberia for another failed project).

Around this time 5 years ago, a large portion of the full-time staff was moved from the Solution Center to Mike‚Äôs staff, removing them customer support duties. Other people and positions in ITS were also shuffled. Into this environment, Jim Kurtenbach was hired as the interim CIO. (And you can read the rest of that history in the article posted to this subreddit last week.)

Frank was ‚Äòphased out from management‚Äô over a period of years; after he retired his position was redefined as as a ‚ÄúCustomer Success Manager‚Äù. Cory remained but as the ‚Äòprogram manager‚Äô, despite arguably managing the Solution Center for years prior. 

Most staff at ISU can tell you it takes a solid year before you really have a good grasp on campus and work responsibilities, and another year (or two) before you‚Äôre really fluent. That definitely goes with the complex IT environment within the university.

Dell Higgins was hired in October 2015; the layoffs occurred May 25, 2016. According to Dell, she (nor Cory) was unaware of any planned re-organization and layoff prior to May 25th, and there hadn‚Äôt been any detailed discussion or planning of where her department was going with the CIO prior. Obviously, there was some notion of a new way forward with the re-named management title, but it was vague otherwise.

Was there *really* panic about Ebola? It deserved and got a strong public health response because it was a very serious problem, and they managed to contain it, mashallah. It helped that the symptoms are severe and only passed through contact with bodily fluids - this makes transmission hard and detection easy. And it's true that some actors tried to gin up panic in the general population, but did they really do much but show that they were clowns? 

So I'm not sure what you're trying to get at here. Sure, random students don't need to be running around like chickens with their heads cut off.

131,Post,"The walk to the union was like any other bitterly cold January day,  students making their uncomfortable and brief transition from their mundane lectures toward the nearest source of orange chicken that a college student could get their chopsticks on.



That's when I saw him.


I was taking off my final of three layers of gloves in the gold star hall, when a man wearing only flip flops, oakleys and shorts phased through the double doors on the north side of the MU. He then proceeded to do several laps around the zodiac, before finally crossing it, defying all that this institution deems holy. 

I was awestruck at this sight.  He strode across the relic with such grace and disregard for tradition that I could not look away. In all my years at this university, I have never witnessed an individual cross the zodiac without being instantly vaporized.  Only the most powerful Iowa Staters could perform such a task. 

Upon closer inspection, the shorts he was wearing appeared to once be a pair of pajamas, hastily cut at the knee. My suspicions were soon confirmed after he crossed the threshold inside.  

He removed the legs of the pj's from his Destination Iowa State bag, and started reattaching them with thread and needle in front of me. He then removed a pair of overalls, wool parka, and snowboarding googles from the very same drawstring bag, and started putting them on. The man started clothing himself like he was about to walk back outside, but then continued to waltz past me, deeper into the building. 

My confusion was second only to my curiosity as I followed him.

He was easy to track, due to the practical river of sweat running down his overalls, onto his flip flops, then the floor.  
He ended up in purchasing spicy chicken tenders and fries in the food court, without any dipping sauce. I never saw him actually eat any of the tenders or fries, he just set them on his skin, and the folds of his flesh engulfed the food like some sort of amoeba. 

After he had finished eating(?) his lunch, he made his way back toward the fountain upstairs.  I almost missed him, since he seemed to simply phase through the ceiling of the food court. 

I found him removing his winter clothing on a bench, steam radiating off of his bristling musculature. stripping down to his original pajorts and flip flops, he made his way back to the zodiac.  He did several more laps in reverse this time, before moonwalking across, into the blustery Iowa weather. 

As he left, I checked my phone.  Almost 4 hours had passed at this point, but it only felt like seconds.  

I do not understand much about the creature I witnessed today, but I would remember for the rest of my life that this was a man who had chosen his own adventure, even in defiance of god.

132,Comment,">You will get tired of it, so it‚Äôs important to make sure you‚Äôre trying different dining halls.

This used to be even more so back in the day.  UDCC was the first of the open concept, ""station"" style dining centers that run the same cycle of selections daily or weekly.

Before UDCC, all the halls (New RCA, Linden, Oak-Elm, Friley Windows & Dungeons, and the Towers) were chow-line style, and they all had different menu cycles and certain things that each one did well and not so well.",0,2,,11uvjz9,t1_jcr53ip,/r/iastate/comments/11uvjz9/dining_hall_food/jcsbcta/

As to the validity... well the average for the past several years has been about 1 in 4 or 1 in 5 pregnancies that are terminated. So the 25% isn't misleading.

Just now I found two single gloves left on different seats on my bus.  This happens daily in the winter.

Pro tip: Remember your other glove.

In case you do forget something on the bus, call Cyride.  We have a lost and found.  Something that's not all that valuable (like a single glove) will not be a high priority, so the dispatchers may ask you to wait until the next day to check rather than calling all of the buses on the radio and having all 80-ish drivers look for a single glove and having 10 of them call back and say they have one.

I‚Äôve been to two Iowa State Cyclones duals. The dual I went to during the 2019-20 season had a 10 or 15 break in the middle. There was no intermission when I went this last weekend. (We therefore didn‚Äôt get Clone Cones.)

Was an intermission tried and then rejected? Is it only some duals (Big 12) that have the intermission?

I posted this question in r/wrestling and the best answer was that it‚Äôs up to the host. The Big 10 duals have intermissions.

222,Post,"It's not abnormal to believe everyday feels somewhat the same.

My Summer semester was a joyous time; productive, consistent and successful. 

The Autumn semester is none of that. As the sun continues its quicker descent from our sky, so does the hope of getting good grades. 

Sometimes you need to slow down to go fast. The accelerated semester only slows down the ability to learn. 

In this test of time, we are only learning how our bodies and mind react to the experiment that is known as the ""fast Fall.""

The hybrid classes are a split personality; stay away, but only come to me when I say you should, sometimes, maybe, idk..

It's hard to pay attention to online lectures when you have a lot on your mind. It's even harder to pay attention when nothing's on your mind. 

Some school days I transition from staring at the computer screen at home, to staring at it later on in class, to thinking about when I'm going to stare at it and what I'm going to see on it when I get home. 

I occasionally have weak moments. Those moments consist of reloading a page I'm already staring at.  

I do however, get my exercise and workouts in. They're great. I relieve a lot of stress during a heavy workout. Then I realize it's too late to start cooking my meal afterwards and resort to some protein bar. 

The weekends are great time to enjoy doing your favorite pastimes while thinking about the homework due on Canvas at 11:59 PM Sunday.

While it's not always the case, homework imprisons your mind from thinking about anything else and your body from moving anywhere else without guilt. It does feel good to complete these pesky assignments, only to realize the speedy semester shows your next assignment due tomorrow night. 

The exams can be indifferent. They're a great way to show everything you forgot, as you realize learning to memorize does more harm than good. 

Make friends. You will soon realize you're not the only one reloading pages you're already staring at.

Remember to have relaxing moments to yourself. Watch a YouTube video you keep putting off. But you have to sit through an advert; before it is revealed, you know it starts with: ""I'm Thersea Greenfield."" You feel like these agonizing ads will make you cursed, as you sit through ad 2 spewing: ""I'm Joni Ernst.""

Is school giving you a purpose? Is it setting you up for success? You're working hard now to work harder later. Light me another match; I'm starting to burn out. 

Going to school doesn't mean much when you're only going to one corner of campus before retreating back home. Maybe I'm not being innovative by not going to the Student Innovation Center.

Typically, that Sunday evening before a week of school always gave me that dreadful feeling. Now I get to enjoy it every other day.

Thanksgiving is getting close, but that group project is getting closer. 

This line is just here to remind you that you need to stop getting distracted from that assignment you're currently working on.

Our semester is moving so fast, that Winter break will be so slow. 

We're in a mess that's screwing with our lives. It moves so fast and in the end, gives you a clear picture of the mass destruction caused by our shortcomings. We aren't called Cyclones for nothing. 

Just remind yourself that you made it into the spooky season of the semester. That's more than the skeleton could ever do. He just doesn't have the guts to do it. 

I don't have much more, but here's some advice. Just keep up with your classes. They're giving you purpose. They're moving with or without you, so you might as well take command and finish what you started. You're a Cyclone, not an Atlanta Falcon, so don't start blowing opportunities to succeed. 

That's all I have for now. Look for another one after Thanksgiving. Peace",3,118,0.98,ja996m,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/ja996m/my_composition_of_this_semester/

Lyon, Freeman, and Barton have a reputation even within the rest of Old RCA as being odd and tight-knit.  The other buildings (Linden, Oak-Elm, Birch-Welsh-Roberts) you have multiple houses per floor, so you'll have non-house thru traffic which changes the dynamic a bit.

> Plus it is right next to conversations which in my opinion is the best dining hall on campus

* Charging $250 for a first offense replacement key.

* before the lease started campustown stated they would replace the torn ragged carpet. It was not replaced until ~20 complaints put in and 1.5 years go by. Then they only replaced patches of it and tried to pass all costs (in the thousands) to the tenants. Carpet was also changed without notice so there were odd men in the apartment moving items out, it looked like a very large scale robbery.
* change locks without warning locking tenants outside overnight. No one answered the emergency line.
* bricks from chimney calling in alley. Manager refused to replace until they were threatened with a lawsuit.
* A\C controls and heat controls are actually linked to another apartment, so tenants are at the whim of someone else, often leading to 95+ degrees in the summer. (They finally added 2 window AC units in the 5 bed 1 bath apartment)
* wires hanging from the ceiling in units against city code and maintenance is untimely if it happens at all
* animals have been known to run through the walls, one has died in there and it took about a week for anyone to act on it

As a student, a starting wage of $13/hr plus all the other benefits (working on campus, free meal with your shift, working around classes, etc.) is a great deal and I would recommend it for anyone.

As a merit staff though, unless you are planning on working for the university until you retire, I would say look at other jobs which are better at staying up with inflation/higher cost of living.",0,4,,vhdvtx,t3_vhdvtx,/r/iastate/comments/vhdvtx/any_news_about_isu_dinings_wage/id94403/

This course does come to the end of the final set of courses a math student takes, so hopefully by the time they get there they will have built up the mathematical repertoire to handle the course.

The hardest in terms of students struggling might be MATH 201 (Introduction to Proofs) because this is a dramatic 90^o turn from what people are used to seeing in their mathematics.  Before this point the vast majority of mathematics has been computational; now suddenly it becomes about proofs and ideas, logic and how to show things are true.

316,Post,"I believe I'm in the majority when I say I did not like finding the mandatory mental health course on my canvas page. However, I actually did the course, and I still have some *dislike*. Instead of keeping it built up inside myself, I shall instead bestow upon you all my mental health tips for both you and those around you.

**-For Yourself-**

In airplanes, you may notice that on safety equipment that it says to help yourself before you help others. This is for good reason: if you don't help yourself first, you may endanger both yourself and whoever you're trying to help, and may not be able to save either of you. When focusing on mental health, make sure yours is stable first before trying to help others; and if yours begins to fall when trying to help, understand that it's OK to step away to pick yourself back up first.

**Food - You need it**

Surprise: you need to eat food to survive. Another surprise: the type of food you eat can be linked to your mental health ([link](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/nutritional-psychiatry-your-brain-on-food-201511168626)). Eating healthier foods can lead to a healthier mindset, or at least a reduction in depressive symptoms. All the processed foods and sugars of the modern world lead to a poorer mental state. Try eating a fruit every once and awhile, maybe even a vegetable if you're feeling adventurous. It may make you feel better.

**Water - You also need it**

Water is extremely important in case you couldn't tell. You're body is about 60% water, and you're brain is about 70% water. Can you guess what happens to your body and mental state if you don't drink enough water? If you guessed ""bad emotional state"" you would be correct! ([link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6147771/)) Go chug some plain water. NOT SODA, NOT GATORADE, NOT ICED TEA; PLAIN H20.

**Hobbies - The fun stuff**

So you're doing the stuff needed to survive. That's good, but it's nothing without the reason to live: aka the stuff you actually want to do. Hobbies decrease your stress-levels and give you some breathing room before hurling yourself back into life. You need to reduce stress, otherwise it can manifest in some... poor ways, such as anxiety, depression, and even physical symptoms like sickness if not taken care of.

*""But I don't have any hobbies""*

Great news, the world is full of things to do, and a lot of them don't require much or anything at all. Here's a short list of things you can try that only require you and maybe a phone:

\*Drawing (landscapes, portraits, doodles)

\*Writing (short stories, a full novel, reddit posts, ect)

\*Photography (take out your phone and snap some shots)

\*Music (Pick up an instrument someone left behind or sing until your roommates kick you out)

\*Collecting things (Campus has some nice rocks you could make a collection out of)

*""But my hobbies don't interest me anymore""*

That's depression, buddy. You're already in the fray of some mental health issues. Try gently forcing yourself to do something you used to enjoy for 10 minutes. You may not want to do it at first, but if you get into the flow you'll feel better afterwards.

**The Socials**

Humans are social creatures; it's how we got to where we are today. Remember to hang out with people you like and to not isolate yourself, otherwise you may find yourself facing some bad brain vibes. It's one of the big reasons mental health issues have increased since quarantine: people can't interact with others and their mental health plummets. If you can't go out, make a call. Can't speak, send a text. They won't make the same impact as hanging out in person, but it's better than nothing.

**Meditation - It's not that bad**

Meditation is one of the BIGGEST things every therapist has ever gotten on my ass about. But they never told me HOW, only that I need/should do it. When I finally found good resources, I realized it doesn't have to be sitting crossed-legged in a dark room chanting to myself. Better still, meditation is ""fully customizable"", so if this doesn't work for you, you can change aspects (or the whole shi-bang) to match what you need.

1. Sit comfortably

or lay down, or lean against a wall; whatever makes you relax. You want to be able to be at ease for a few minutes, so do what needs to be done.

2.  Check yourself

I can't think of a better way of putting this, but as you are sitting (laying, whatever), note how your body feels. Does your leg hurt, are your hands tense, is your jaw clenched? Just think about how you feel in your body. Check in with yourself.

2b. Relax

Those issues you noticed like 5 seconds ago? Remedy the ones you can. If your jaw is clenched, unclench it. If your hands are tense, try gently stretching them. If your leg is in pain, try massaging it briefly, but if the pain is mild enough or you cannot fix it in the moment, you may ignore it.

3. Breathe (but structured)

Fun fact: the way you're breathing can affect the mood you're in. Rapid breaths can make you tense and anxious, while calm, deep breaths help you relax ([link](http://medcraveonline.com/MOJAP/MOJAP-03-00108.pdf)). The geniuses of the ancient world realized we can use this to our advantage during meditation. Try slowing down, and breathing and exhaling to a certain count (such as inhaling for 5 seconds, exhaling for 5 seconds, and repeating) while you're sitting, keeping track in your head.

4. Observe your thoughts

Most of the day, you're likely focused on having the most productive thoughts. Anything that doesn't help in the moment or in the future is pushed aside for a better thought. NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR THIS. Instead, let every thought pass through, not interacting with any of them positively or negatively. Think of it as cloud watching if you must.

Congratulations, you've learned how to meditate. Yes, it's that easy

*""OK, but what if I want to be hardcore about meditation?""*

Then I'd think you're a masochist but I have more for you:

1. Try meditation music or subliminals to help you relax more. This gives the additional benefit of blocking out excess noise around you and lets you concentrate on breathing/watching your thoughts
2. Try the 4-7-8 breathing method, where you inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, exhale for 8, and repeat. It's one of the most common breathing patterns used in meditation and is surprisingly quick in its effects.
3. Note where your thoughts go. You're still just watching them, but as they pass you may realize connections between them that give greater insight to your inner emotional state.
4. Do more research. Meditation, because of its uniqueness to each individual, has SO MUCH stuff about it on the internet. Research more about it, and

**Get help**

I know it better than most; sometimes you can't help yourself. You need to seek out help from others sometimes. It may just be talking things through with a friend or parent, or it can be scheduling an appointment with a therapist or counselor. You need to realize it's ok to ask for help; you deserve it far more than most people are willing to accept. Campus has resources, but you can find others online

*On-Campus Counseling* \- There is counseling available on campus, with a choice between group and individual. [https://www.counseling.iastate.edu/services/counseling/](https://www.counseling.iastate.edu/services/counseling/)

*The NIH* \- Lots of resources for finding help around you and phone lines when you need to talk. [https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/find-help/index.shtml](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/find-help/index.shtml)

*Bliss* \- Interactive depression therapy using CBT thought-processes to help you rewire yourself into thinking less like a depressed person. Also free 8 sessions, much easier than a therapist, but not a replacement. [https://cimhs.com/](https://cimhs.com/)

*MentalHealth.gov* \- The government does care; full of resources such as finding the warning signs, how to get help, and more. [https://www.mentalhealth.gov/](https://www.mentalhealth.gov/)

**Wait**

The storm doesn't care that you had plans, and persists anyhow. Sometimes, even doing everything right you will have bad days. Understand it, and don't beat yourself up for it. Just wait out the storm, and pick up the pieces when it passes.

**-For Others-**

Congrats, you're functional! Or more so, since you can help and may choose to help others. Remember that it‚Äôs OK to step away if a situation affects your mental health, and that sometimes you as an average person may not be correctly suited to help someone in a poor mental state. If you can help someone, however, here are a few things to remember.

**How to recognize issues in others**

In short, you can't all the time. Some people will be quieter, some will get louder. Some will eat less, some will eat more. Some will not even show any signs to the outside world until the worst happens. Instead of looking for specific signs, instead look for things that are different in particular to your person. Know your person, and if their behavior changes, ask them about it. It may open them up to discussing what's been going on.

**Listen**

I don't care if there is a singing baboon behind the person. If they're talking, you're listening. Don't interject, don't take the conversation off topic, don't ignore them. Listen. Speak when necessary/when you would usually, but try to listen as much as possible. The person you're listening to will appreciate a friendly ear to hear them out more than a conversation about sport-ball.

**Be natural**

My biggest gripe with the mandatory mental health course (aside from being mandatory) was that the situation it showed was sterile and textbook as hell. What do I mean? When was the last time you had a conversation even close to how theirs played out? Exactly. Try to keep the conversation natural. If you normally make jokes, you can still make jokes. If you like telling stories you can tell a story. Remember to listen, but also realize that suddenly treating the person you're talking to differently can be isolating and upsetting, which will not help a mentally unhealthy person.

**Include them in activities**

You may find that your friend has been distant for awhile. This may be them isolating themselves due to some mental health issues. Remember to try and include them in plans, even if they always refuse. The gesture means more than they may let on, and reminds them of the people who care about them.

**Know when to step away**

You can‚Äôt help everyone as much as you want to. Sometimes, you have to let professionals do their jobs. If someone is suicidal, there isn‚Äôt much you as a normal person can do. Be able to step away and call people who can help. The resources from above may be useful for finding numbers to call.

&#x200B;

Congratulations, you made it to the end. Instead of a certificate of completion, I'll give you this ascii cat - > =\^..\^=

&#x200B;

EDIT: Additional Points for Self-Care:

&#x200B;

**SLEEP**

Look, I know you have shit to do, we all do. But you're not doing yourself any favors by staying up into the night. Not sleeping causes more mental troubles, which causes more trouble sleeping (a real catch-22 there, eh?) (([https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-10343-008](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-10343-008))). Do yourself a favor and get in some uninterrupted sleep. Your work will still be there in the morning, and you'll do a much better job well rested than not.

**Go Outside**

Groundbreak-Dot18 made this point below, but it bears repeating: go outside! The sunlight can be good for both your mental and physical health ( ([https://www.cfp.ca/content/cfp/52/4/422.full.pdf](https://www.cfp.ca/content/cfp/52/4/422.full.pdf))). If you can't go outside, try sitting by an open window to get that sweet vitamin D. Sitting outside in the sunlight is better than sitting inside in the dark.

**Exercise**

I have a love-hate relationship with exercise, as I'm sure some of you do as well. But getting just a little bit of sweat in a day will ease some of the mental strain of life (([https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/depression-and-exercise/art-20046495](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/depression-and-exercise/art-20046495))). Find some activity you can do and try to do it daily. I do yoga on my good days and a single sit-up every hour on bad days. It doesn't have to be hard, just something to give your heart beating.

**Hygiene**

Some days, you're not going to want to get out of bed. That's fully valid, but try to remain clean. Even just a wet rag on the face and underarms will make you feel better than sitting in your stink (no resources here, just personal experience). If you have the energy, try brushing your teeth and showering. Even if you do nothing else during the day, you'll still feel better.

**Social Media**
Who could've guessed, social media can be a pest on the ol' noggin, especially in ""unpreceded times"". Remember to give yourself breaks from social media every once and awhile (yes, even Reddit). Too much social media involvement can increase your feelings of loneliness and depression, which is not helpful when you're already vulnerable (([https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/10.1521/jscp.2018.37.10.751](https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/10.1521/jscp.2018.37.10.751))). Use that time to meditate, do a hobby, or even just sit and look out a window.

Fellow ISU Dining employee here. Just wanted to let you know about the GetApp. That app basically removes the need to swipe your card at dining centers everytime you eat. You just download the app and scan the barcode at the entrance and you're good to go. This allows for no contact transactions between you and the ISU Dining employees thus reducing the chances of transmission incase either of the people involved have COVID. It also saves time and is also overall more convenient.

329,Comment,"The most straight-forward solutions are to break up the patterns on the glass.

This can be achieved by putting applications on your exterior windows (like [Feather Friendly adhesive dots](https://abcbirds.org/feather-friendly-diy/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsem1ivXN6wIVjIbACh0ZmgNKEAAYASAAEgJGO_D_BwE), or [Acopian bird savers](https://www.birdsavers.com/) which are strings that hang from top to bottom). This solution is best for residential buildings, since windows tend to be smaller and more accessible (larger structures can be equipped with these as well, but that tends to be pricey and difficult to install).

Other structures can benefit from using frosted or etched glass, that either has a tight pattern on it or simply covers the entirety of the reflective glass. UV-coated glass is also an option, albeit not the best. Most birds can see in the UV spectrum while humans can't, so if you have a UV pattern on the glass for the birds, it won't be ""ugly"" to the humans. Unfortunately, not all bird species see UV, including doves, who happen to hit windows pretty often.

On a larger scale, buildings can be designed in a way that allows birds to escape easier. Tight inward corners, alcoves, or anything remotely u-shaped should be avoided in building design if you're trying to be bird-friendly. It's good to avoid because birds will have more options for flight paths (note: they won't want to fly upward because avian predators are a thing). You should also avoid planting trees super close to glass (*ahem* looking at you, Parks...)

On a broader scale, more cities should be implementing ""Lights Out"" programs during months of migration. This simply means that they encourage businesses and college campuses to reduce lighting at night, since lighting has a large impact on our nocturnal migrants (most songbirds in North America migrate at night). Many large cities have Lights Out programs, like Cleveland, New York City, and Pittsburgh. This would be the cheapest option out of all of them, I would guess.

TL;DR: Window applications that break up reflections, smart building design, and Lights Out programs.",1,55,,im234d,t1_g3wl76g,/r/iastate/comments/im234d/please_report_dead_birds_you_see_on_campus_to_me/g3wntbf/

I said my name and we started talking about our majors and that typical stuff. but I couldn't think of how to keep the conversation going at one point. I pulled out my phone and asked if she wanted to see my vegetable garden from my hometown. She nodded and I started going through pics.

I think she was really interested and I thought she really liked me and she was pretty too so i asked her ""Do you want to date?"" and she said ""ummm no im sorry.""

General exercise can decrease depressive/anxiety symptoms ([link](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/depression-and-exercise/art-20046495)), and combining that with going outside would also decrease these symptoms as well as multiple physical aliments ([link](https://www.cfp.ca/content/cfp/52/4/422.full.pdf)).

400,Post,"I live in SUV and been buying a mix of meal blocks and some dining dollars for the past few semesters which worked perfectly for a random lunch on campus and a few things from the C-Store here and there, but then started to really think about it. 



When using a meal for Froots, Hawthorne or Clyde's, you're actually loosing money every time. I used to buy a 50 meal block, which was roughly $10.50 a meal, but a typical bundle at Clyde's or Hawthorne is like $8-$9, so you're losing ~$2 every meal you use. When using a bundle for Froots, you're spending $10.50 on a $6 smoothie, losing even more. The only instance where you're not losing money would be at Seasons/UDCC/Conversations where a meal cost $11 but if you buy enough Dining Dollars, you get a discount though, so even that evens out for the same cost.



So overall, you're going to save money on pretty much any meal bundle you use, have more freedom for your meals (Don't have to get 2 sides or can get whatever you want from the C-Store for a ""side"" instead for pretty much same price), and have the ability to use those extra dining dollars on whatever the hell you want.




In this post I use estimates, but I actually spent some time going through the actual numbers comparing a 50 meal block to equivalent dining dollars and the math checks out. This might not be true for the 25 meal blocks, but it should be even if anything. Also, the prices for blocks/DD can change so this might not be true for future years. Double check the math if you're hesitant and you should come to the same conclusion, just trying to help people out with this advice.",7,41,0.97,5797mz,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/5797mz/for_those_of_you_buying_meal_blocks_dont_buy/

407,Post,"I started writing this as a comment on another thread, but I just kept going and going and decided it would be cool to hear other peoples stories.

I was in the class of 2022, 4 years. My freshmen year was normal. My sophomore year came around, and I was having a blast. I had just switched my major, and things were going pretty well for me. Then, spring break hit, and I never came back.

Junior year was awful. I was back on campus, but everything was online, so I don't even know why I bothered living in Freddy. Also, the two month winter break was fucking wild.

I will say, I did get to experience a bunch of things that while I'll hopefully never experience again, were cool, and I'll have a lot of stories to tell.

When I came up for a weekend to pack up my apartment, my roommate and I went on a walk. It was so erie. Nobody was around. We walked down an empty Welch avenue on a Saturday night.

Also, I managed to get sent to quarantine housing. It was nuts. Two people showed up and moved me into oak elm. I got food delivered every morning, and I was also allowed to leave for ""15 minute outside walks with my mask on"".

This was January and it was freezing. I did not go on any walks. ISU dining also paid me for my missed shifts, which I appreciated

I only had one lecture that I was supposed to attend synchronously, and it was at like 2pm. Time no longer had meaning.

My first day there I slept through food ordering time without realizing it, so I just... only ate their provided peanut butter crackers. I apparently had too much social anxiety to realize I could have called them and explained I needed food.

The next day they called to check in on me, and I joked that I would be setting an alarm to remember ordering food from now on, I was then told off for not telling them I had no food.

Ah. Memories.

He was an okay professor at teaching, but he was so condescending and rude that I never went to office hours because of it. He would tell us we were stupid for not going, but when I went, he would just ridicule me for not knowing what I needed help on. I got a B- but maybe I could‚Äôve gotten a little bit higher if I would‚Äôve had a better professor that I could‚Äôve gone to office hours for

CE 206 was an awful class. Literally got the bare minimum to pass, Matt is a great guy just makes the class ridiculously hard. 

10/10 on the rating and commentary of your classes. I take it you‚Äôre taking fluids and structural analysis next year? Structural analysis is fun (basically statics but without all the unnecessary tricks), fluids will be ass if it‚Äôs Jon Fleming who teaches it.

Good luck on the rest of your curriculum!",1,2,,1cnuv5p,t3_1cnuv5p,/r/iastate/comments/1cnuv5p/rating_my_classes_i_took_this_year_fall/l408kt8/
544,Post,"I see that we have a few dining halls close to Lyon (my dorm), Conversations, one at MU and another Get and Go east side.

I have enrolled into the Gold plan. Do I have access to all of these 3 places above? Is the food pretty ok at these location - do they have pizzas/pasta/wraps?

When it is super cold / snowing heavily outside, is there a limited food option within Lyon itself or do we have to go out to one of these 3 places? 

  
Finally, if you are a guy who likes pizzas/food, is the gold plan adequate to fill you up or are you going to have to hit the candy machines a couple hours after lunch?

563,Post,"I'm selling an Asus ROG Laptop (with a transferable warranty until next summer) in the area for about $700, and I haven't had a ton of luck on FB Marketplace or anything so I thought I'd try selling it here cuz I'm very desperate. There's nothing wrong with it, and I took it to classes and everything with no issues, I just want to raise funds to build a desktop. I'm sure it can run autodesk and blender and all of that jazz.

Here are the specs: 

120 Hz monitor

Nvidia GTX 1060 Graphics Card (this is an actual 1060 I believe, not just the laptop version)

16 GB ram

128 GB SSD Space

1 TB HDD Space

Intel core I7-7700 HQ CPU 2.8 ghz (I believe overclocking is available but I'm not sure)

Windows 10

A couple of things:

It comes with a Best Buy Geek Squad warranty until next summer, but I'm not sure of the exact date. I'll transfer this warranty if/when you buy it

Rarely, the fans will have a slight rattle on startup, but I've never noticed it after a few minutes and it doesn't happen all that often in the first place. That being said, this can easily be fixed with the Best Buy warranty if you want.

The battery doesn't hold the longest charge, but it also hasn't degraded since I bought it. If you want, you can also get a new battery replacement for free from Best Buy that doesn't take away any of the balance in the warranty.

604,Comment,"I used to be a Math 151 tutor Spring 23. It was fine. If you‚Äôre a Math eager, it should be okay to help students with what you know. Just remember to be gentle to them all. It also depends on your students as I had a really smart one. He got 95 on final *shocked*. 

I mean of course tutoring give you a better bullet point on your resumes compared to the Tutoring, so why not? Unless you‚Äôre are a Supervisor or SAM. But carefully consider as SAM got paid 18/hr, pretty promising, isn‚Äôt it?

Fall 23, I decided to quit tutoring as they changed the system, which is a big downhill to me. I found it time consuming to do lesson plans as Math tutors always have mathematics system in there head, and ways to stimulate students' brain working on the problem. Active learning strategies are helpful to some extent, but I didn't like how the center made us fill em all up on the paper. We‚Äôre paid to do those documents, however, I can‚Äôt stand them.

Cherry Coke started spilling all over the floor and down his arm, and my jaw dropped in shock. He just looked over at me and smiled with his overflowing cup still under the drink dispenser, and I think one of his friends laughed from a distance.

620,Comment,"Yeah if you have a bunch of extra cash saved it's better than dining dollars but the same is true for every meal swipe you buy. They're very expensive. But I'm assuming a freshman won't have much cash available. 

Dining dollars are also useful late at night where dining hall hours are limited. And the dude is living in Friley. I know there's a CVS near there now but getting to Hyvee and Walmart is a real pain especially when you have groceries on the way back. Not to mention little storage in your dorm room.

Eating twice a day at the dining center 3 days a week is plenty imo. Weekends alone are unstructured enough to make it make sense. If you go home for a weekend, that's 10 meals for 5 weekdays.

It's quiet, and I get the space I need. But holy shit, the heat is unbearable; I can barely think or do my work, and I can't even chalk it up to natural causes like I could in the summer. The temperature of my room if I close one of my windows (as recorded by my clock and my fan both) can shoot all the way up to 90 degrees. 

I know it's not exactly a building known for being modern or in great condition, but I feel like something is wrong if I get nauseous, start trembling, and have to seriously question myself as to whether or not I'm beginning to display symptoms of heat exhaustion. No air-conditioning is one thing, but it's 35 degrees out right as I make this post. Is it really okay for school housing to be this much of a health hazard?

682,Comment,I've worked with ISU Catering since Sophomore year (now a Senior) and I've enjoyed it. The hours can be really early or late which is why pay starts at $12/hour with 50 cent raises once you work a certain number of hours. It's pretty easy to advance as well Student Supervisors make $14/hr and Student Assistant Managers $18/hr. As long as you have a good work ethic you would do well and can work with some fun people. You also work some VIP events like and can meet people high up in the university and in state government.,0,7,,kn3pe9,t3_kn3pe9,/r/iastate/comments/kn3pe9/thinking_of_getting_an_on_campus_job/ghka7bj/

689,Post,"Seems the secret society elites finally put their plan in to motion to eliminate coffee creamer throughout campus.¬π The west shop stopped putting out the singles last year. MU and library shop may still have that thermos thing with cream but it is always out. The dining centers I've been to stopped putting it out this year. If you know a reliable place to find free coffee creamer on campus I'll pay you 5 big ones for that info.¬≤ I know $5 would buy my own coffee creamer but this quandary obviously goes far beyond just coffee expenses.

690,Comment,"* Do not fall behind!  It is easy to push things off until exams, but with mathematics, consistency is key.
* It's OK to be frustrated.  Mathematics is a new skill and like any other skill (e.g., learning to play the piano) when you start you sound terrible, but get better with practice.  Use frustration to push you to do more.
* Don't assume because the professor makes it look easy that it is easy.  They have thousands of hours of learning from stupid mistakes behind their work, you will also need to invest in time to get better.
* Get your hands on as many problems as you can, the harder the better.  I put together a page with some [calculus resources](https://orion.math.iastate.edu/butler/calculus/).
* When doing problems don't automatically jump to the solutions when you get stuck.  Fight with the problem, either you will overcome the problem and be the better for it, or when you finally do look at the solutions you will say ""Doh!  I will never make that mistake again."" (of course new mistakes are possible).
* Meet friends and form study groups.  You are not the only one who is struggling, find people around you who are struggling and work with them together, bounce ideas off of each other.
* Use office hours to get help, office hours are specifically set aside as times to get help from the instructor.  If the instructor's office hours are not convenient there are many additional office hours available (go to the ""Math Help"" session of the math department website).

TL;DR: do lots of math to get better at math

Edit:  Remember that problems don't exist in isolation.  So after you have done a problem, stop for a moment and analyze the problem.  ""What did you do to find the answer?""  ""Why did you do it that way?""  ""What about the problem told you that is the way it should be done?""  ""How will you know how to recognize a similar problem?""  A lot of mathematics is pattern recognition and so if you spot the patterns, you are already ahead of the game.

On a related note, learn from your mistakes.  In particular when you get a test or quiz back go over it in detail and see what kind of mistakes you made.  Then focus on making sure you will not make those same mistakes again (now there will be new mistakes you can make).  In a fairly short amount of time you will see that the number of stupid mistakes goes down, in a medium amount of time the number of smart mistakes will also go down.",0,4,,71yh62,t1_dneopdb,/r/iastate/comments/71yh62/i_am_a_steve_butler_ask_me_anything/dnepfr0/

720,Comment,"I did a three year stint at ITS and knew several people who worked ITS full-time, but the good ones never stayed long because they couldn't stand the bureaucracy.  At that time (2007-2010 era), the organization was riddled with lazy and ineffective full-time employees.  Maybe he's doing great stuff, maybe he's messing it all up.  But I do know that over the last decade, the cruft had gotten too thick.  One example I can recall is how one of the senior full-time ITS staff would play AoE at work quite regularly, and in front of other employees.  It didn't slow any of us down though; we still got everything done that needed to be done.  
So when you have that going on... how can anyone be surprised about a FT position just getting completely axed?

736,Post,"###Welcome and Welcome back to ISU! Lots of new information with CyRide this year.
Hello all, and congratulations to those that are graduating from ISU! I hope everyone had a great summer.

For those of you that don't know me, I'm Mike and I've been with CyRide for over 9 years now. I started as a driver back in 2015, became a Transit Dispatcher in 2016, became a Transit Trainer in 2022, and as of August 1st, 2024, accepted a promotion to Transit Operations Manager!

I will generally post CyRide updates here each semester to let everyone know what's going on with CyRide and what you can expect for the year. I'll also post updates for any major detours, severe weather, or anything else that might impact service.

Normally these updates are pretty generic, but this year there's a **TON** of new things happening with CyRide and your experience, so I'll start with the most important stuff first. If you have any questions, feel free to let me know! There's also a TL;DR at the bottom you'd just like the basics.

###Fall Schedule

Fall schedule starts on Monday, August 19th, but during this week before classes start we will be running a [modified break schedule.](https://www.cyride.com/Home/Components/News/News/4100/1342?backlist=%2f) The provided link is more detailed, but in a nutshell, this week we will be running a break schedule but adding some trips in for #25 Gold Route. 

On Monday, August 26th, we will be running full service with all trips active. You can view our printed schedule [here.](https://www.cyride.com/schedules/school-year-schedule)

Prediction services should be updated and accurate for this week (see below for more information on that!)

---

###Major Route update for #23 Orange 

'#23 Orange Route will be on a detour for the next two years due to the [LeBaron expansion project.](https://www.amestrib.com/story/news/local/2024/04/24/iowa-state-university-lebaron-hall-is-getting-a-51-5-million-makeover/73387779007/) Morrill Road between Osborne drive will be inaccessible to CyRide buses during the entire duration of this project, which means Orange will be on an entirely different route during this time.

You can see the new Orange route [here.](https://www.cyride.com/maps/school-year-maps/individual-pdf-maps/23-orange-map)

If you noticed, it's not really that much different than normal Orange - it just goes one block further over to Bissell. This route change will significantly impact the timing of the buses, however we did add more scheduled trips of Orange in the schedule to account for the time delay.

Once Morrill Road reopens in 2026, Orange route should go back to its normal route.

Simply download the CyRide version of the Transit App using the links below. NOTE: There will be a CyRide branded version of this app coming shortly. 

MyState and Transit App are two CyRide supported applications. If these aren't your style, Ames Ride is also a great alternative that provides excellent predictions and was created by your own ISU Alumni, Patrick Demers.

You can download any of these on your app store:

* MyState ([Apple link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mystate/id548641772)) ---
 ([Google Play link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.iastate.MyState))
* Transit App ([Apple link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/transit-subway-bus-times/id498151501)) --- ([Google Play link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thetransitapp.droid))
* AmesRide ([Apple link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ames-ride/id1666007719)) --- ([Google Play link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.demerstech.amesride))

In the Fall of 2023, the vendor that provides bus locations had a major system malfunction during the first two weeks of class which essentially broke the predictions from all the apps. After ongoing communications with the vendor they have *assured* CyRide that after some major updates this should not happen again. 

#**However,**

If there is a major malfunction again, I would highly recommend reviewing the [printed schedule.](https://www.cyride.com/schedules/school-year-schedule) You can also call CyRide and a receptionist or dispatcher should be able to answer your questions almost immediately regarding any questions you have about when a bus is supposed to arrive. Seriously, don't be afraid to call us with any questions you have regarding how to ride, route/time information, lost and found, or any other inquires. Our phones are active from 7:00am until the end of service for the day.

###Cyclone Welcome Weekend

Cyclone Welcome Weekend is this Friday, August 23rd and Saturday, August 24th. Iowa State will be providing activities for students during this time, and you can find more information about that [here.](https://studentaffairs.iastate.edu/welcomeweekend)

CyRide will be providing expanded service on Friday evening and all day Saturday to assist with this. While we cannot run ""shuttles,"" we have extended service for #25 Gold Route on Friday evening to go until about 11:30pm. 

On Saturday evening, #3 Blue has been expanded to run an additional trip at 10:00pm. We will also have a modified #21 Cardinal and #25 Gold routes leaving CY Stephens at ~10:00pm and ~10:30pm to assist with those leaving the hypnotist activity. We will have sandwich boards on the south side of CY Stephens on Saturday evening providing this information to passengers.


Additionally, we will have ""extra"" buses almost all day on Saturday to assist with capacity issues during Cyclone Welcome Weekend. 

For those still needing a safe ride home after hours (10pm-3am,) we will also be running [Moonlight Express](https://www.cyride.com/schedules/school-year-schedule/moonlight-express) on Friday, August 23rd and Saturday, August 24th.

---

###Fare Free on campus

Starting today, we will be going Fare Free for all stops on ISU campus, meaning that you don't need to show your ISU ID, pay a fare or show a bus pass (non students.) This is being implemented to encourage students to ride other routes rather than just the circulators (21 Cardinal, 23 Orange, 25 Gold) as campus will be extremely congested due to the Orange Route detour listed above. Additionally, we're hoping that a nice side effect is that it will reduce the time to load a bus so that people aren't stuck searching for their ID's, fare, or bus passes.

This is in effect for essentially all stops within the boundaries of Iowa State University, and the stops affected will have a sticker that says ""Fare Free bus stop"" on it. Outside of campus, you will still need your ID or fare to ride into campus on any route that does not start with a ""20."" If you're boarding on campus, no ID or fare is required.

---


###Moonlight Express


[Moonlight Express](https://www.cyride.com/schedules/school-year-schedule/moonlight-express) is a free option for a safe ride home that operates on Friday and Saturday nights from 10:30pm-3:00am while classes are in session. You do not need to pay a fare or show your ISU card to use these services.

Moonlight Express is split into two sections - Fixed route and door to door.

The Moonlight Express ""A"" shuttle follows a fixed route and runs every 20 minutes between West Ames and Campus. See the A shuttle map [here](https://www.cyride.com/maps/school-year-maps/moonlight-express-service-maps/moonlight-a) and the timetables [here.](https://www.cyride.com/schedules/school-year-schedule/moonlight-express/a-shuttle-timetable)

The Moonlight Express ""B"" shuttle also follows a fixed route and runs every 20 minutes between Freddy Court and Campus. See the B shuttle map [here](https://www.cyride.com/maps/school-year-maps/moonlight-express-service-maps/moonlight-b) and the timetables [here.](https://www.cyride.com/schedules/school-year-schedule/moonlight-express/b-shuttle-timetable)

If you need a ride outside of the service zones of the above A & B shuttles, we offer an On-Demand service and can generally get a minibus to you within 10-15 minutes, depending on demand for the night. Call the CyRide office OR download the free [Ride Pingo app](https://ridepingo.com/) through iOS or Android and schedule through that. You can also call CyRide to schedule a ride.

### Rider tips and information

For those of you that are new at ISU, it might be scary or overwhelming to start riding or learn the system. It takes a little bit of time, but you'll quickly get the hang of it.

For starters, you'll only need your ISU ID for any route off-campus that doesn't start with a ""20."" For #21 Cardinal, #23 Orange (most popular), and #25 Gold, you don't need to show anything to ride. 

When you board, please *always* enter through the front door as the driver has to tally you. We've had an ongoing problem with people boarding through the rear doors, especially on #23 Orange which does not give us accurate counts. After you've boarded, either find a seat or continue moving all the way to the back of the bus, especially if it's a busy trip.

When you're ready to deboard, pull the yellow cord or press the stop request buttons throughout the bus. There are some stops which the bus stops at no matter what, but for the majority of stops, the bus will only stop if it is requested. You can exit through any door, front or rear.

If you're new, start by reviewing our [Maps](https://www.cyride.com/maps/summer-maps) and figure out where you live and which routes go by where you're at. The little dots on the map are all bus stops. From there you'll want to look at the [timetables](https://www.cyride.com/schedules/school-year-schedule) to determine what time the bus will depart near you. The SQUARE marks on the map are all timepoints. Note that those timepoints are all ""departure"" times and not arrival times, so I would give yourself an extra minute or two to ensure you don't miss the bus. 

MyState, Transit App, and Ames Ride all have great resources for bus predictions, but won't work properly if there are service disruptions with our provider. My suggestion would be to eventually learn to use the printed timetable to *plan* your trips and know approximately what time the bus will depart, and use the apps to determine where the bus is at in real time. 

The buses all have printed schedules when you board - I would grab one and read the rider information to learn about it. When I went to undergrad years ago, I cut out the timetables for my route and posted them on my whiteboard so I knew exactly when my bus would depart the nearest timepoint to my bus stop.  

Also, like I mentioned earlier: don't be afraid to call us if you have any questions - we are here to help! Additionally, feel free to message me or leave a comment in this thread.

### TL;DR and Thank You!


As always, thank you for riding, and hopefully this update is helpful for new and current ISU students. If you have any comments, questions, or concerns, feel free to drop a comment on this post and I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible.


#TL;DR:
* Fall schedule starts today, 8/19 and is on a modified break schedule through Friday, 8/23
* Full service starts Saturday, 8/24 until the first ISU break session
* Extended service into the evening on Friday 8/23 and Saturday 8/24 to help with Cyclone Welcome Weekend
* Major route update on #23 Orange for the next two years; it will go one block further west to Bissell and then down Union Drive. We have added lines of Orange to account for time delay.
* Download MyState, Transit App, or Ames Ride for real time prediction information.
* We will be fare free on campus - any stop within campus with a ""Free Stop"" sticker is a free bus stop - no ISU card, fare, or pass is required at these stops. Outside of campus you will need your ISU card or fare for any route that doesn't start with a ""20.""
* Moonlight Express is still the same, but we have expanded a ""B"" shuttle that runs from Freddy Court through Campus.
* See rider tips and information above if you are a first time rider.",6,160,0.99,1ew8owl,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/1ew8owl/cyride_fall_2024_update_welcome_back_to_isu/

I am looking to sublease my apartment suite beginning January 1st, 2019. It is located at 2709 Lincoln Way, right across from campus and diagonal from the Dunkin' Donuts.

It's estimated that anywhere between 300 million and 988 million birds die in the US *alone* every year due to window collisions.

With the assistance of a biology professor, I've organized a group of undergraduate biology/animal ecology students to monitor some of our buildings on campus for bird-window collision mortalities. The worst building we're monitoring this fall has been the College of Design. My hope is that we can monitor all if not most buildings on the ISU campus (Ohio State does this! They also have a *lot* of volunteers).

We will be continuing our monitoring for the foreseeable future, but after this year I will be presenting the data we collect to FP&M to install anti-collision measures on existing buildings (there are more permanent options than just drawing with paint markers or applying tape), and changing window requirements for future construction projects (like UV-patterned glass, etched glass).

I‚Äôm an alumni (class of 2023) and I used to work in Convos from 2020-2021. I remember that they used to make this creamy potato soup with bacon bits in it, and every time that soup was available, I‚Äôd get it with my free meal. I am now far away from ISU and I specifically miss this soup, and I never got the recipe since the guy making it was very light lipped about it. Does anyone know the recipe for this soup or have found a recipe similar to the one from Convos? As we are now in soup season, I‚Äôd love to make it for myself.

What you‚Äôve experienced is all freddy court apartments. Maybe look into Schlitter village area. They‚Äôre owned by the university and lots of older students live there. Busses will take you to class. Any off campus apartments near campus will be full of undergrads which can be noisy neighbors.

Since you‚Äôre starting this semester, tour around other places for the fall. In January it‚Äôs harder to be picky about housing as choices are limited to subleases and what‚Äôs left in campus properties.",1,6,,1i3dqkr,t3_1i3dqkr,/r/iastate/comments/1i3dqkr/best_oncampus_residence_for_me/m7pp534/

801,Comment,"This is such a great post! I think it‚Äôs important to view some mental issues as a natural byproduct given a certain set of circumstances, and the hopeful thing being we can have some influence over those circumstances. 

For anyone feeling lost/interested in meditation, check out this link: [https://wiki.healthygamer.gg/en/Meditation\_Techniques](https://wiki.healthygamer.gg/en/Meditation_Techniques)

The wiki creator is a psychiatrist, and suggests meditation for all his patients. He stresses that everyone is unique, so a singular meditation technique is not a one size fits all. Personally, I find Bellow's Breath to work the best, since it's active and I feel tangibly better afterwards.

I also fall asleep quickly after doing Yoga Nidra, which is essentially flexing and relaxing every muscle right before falling asleep. Works wonders.

Each technique described has a video attached with it to show how it's done.

&#x200B;

A lot of these things are easier said than done, but one of my favorite authors repeatedly talks about his principle called the ""do something"" rule. He believes that motivation follows action, which is counterintuitive to what most people believe and feel. Taking even small steps in the direction of progress can snowball into something greater. He explains it very well in this article:

852,Comment,"Thanks, I am glad that you are enjoying the way I teach.

The time constraint is a bit of a challenge and one which we will be reducing tremendously next semester.  But that does not help you for this semester.  You are doing the right things, you are working on the quiz problems, and you are studying.  Let me make one suggestion.

* Focus on learning to recognize problems.

By this I mean that once you finish a problem, spend some time to look back over the problem and identify what tools you used and which tools you didn't use.  What about this problem made you solve it the way you did?  How could you identify a problem like this in the future?

The reason that the time pressure can get to people is that they take a lot of time to figure out how to start.  If you get into the habit of looking at problems afterwords and finding patterns (and math is all about patterns) that will dramatically reduce the time it takes for you to start.  And it turns out that there are not that many questions out there to ask, so if we ask you a question on a test, we have probably asked you something similar before.

My other piece of advice, know how to spend your time.  It is better to make a good start on many problems then to get one most of the way through.  A lot of points are available for people who make a good start.",0,1,,71yh62,t1_dnm3ttm,/r/iastate/comments/71yh62/i_am_a_steve_butler_ask_me_anything/dnmcy95/

 I think the main issue with an idea like this is the fact that I can tell my buddy to hop on his PC/Xbox and we can play right away without meeting somewhere. 

Tournaments would be awesome, but then you have the challenge of hosting tons of tournaments to offset and operating costs. Adding a bar with arcade games might be a way to bring money in outside of tournaments, but there are probably other issues with that idea too.",0,5,,d1ukn5,t3_d1ukn5,/r/iastate/comments/d1ukn5/would_an_esports_center_be_viable_in_ames/ezq0mav/

866,Comment,"What do you want it to be?

The thing is that 0^0 is one of these indeterminant forms.  Which is a fancy way of saying that it corresponds to an ambiguous expression.  The classic example of this is the ratio of 0/0 which is bad **not** because no number can solve it, but rather because every number can solve it.

So when dealing with expressions which are indeterminant, i.e., 0^0 , we turn to limits.  Now this has somehow become a dirty word that should never be spoken around engineers, but at its heart limits are simply asking ""what *should* happen?""  In other words, given what is happening nearby what should the value be.

Now we see that we can run into troubles because there are many ways we might end up with 0^0 .  For instance we could start with x^0 =1 and let x tend to 0 (which tells us the answer should be 1) or we could start with 0^x =0 and let x tend to 0 (which tells us the answer should be 0).

So it all depends on how you get to 0^0 as to what the value should be.

(The preceding is based off of me as a teacher of calculus.  Speaking as a combinatorialist the answer is either 0 or 1 depending on what makes the equations look nicest.)",1,2,,71yh62,t1_dnyr5gh,/r/iastate/comments/71yh62/i_am_a_steve_butler_ask_me_anything/dnyvv1i/

885,Post,"Hey, all.  As the COVID vaccines have begun to roll out over the past month, we've been seeing an uptick in questions about vaccination both here in the sub and elsewhere.  *This is not an official ISU statement* (see flair if you're confused) but I want to provide my take on where we currently are and what we expect in the near future.

*****

**State of the Vaccines (Short Version)**

Numerous companies are developing COVID vaccines.  Normally, this is a multi-year process because of both bureaucratic and funding hurdles.  The urgency of the pandemic has eliminated a lot of those, which is why we're seeing such rapid development.  Safety steps have not been skipped; instead, no one has had to spend multiple years applying for funding, and a lot of things that normally occur in sequence have instead occurred in parallel.

As of today, the FDA has issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for two vaccines - those from Pfizer and Moderna.  Trials have shown both to be ~95% effective in preventing COVID infection.  Both require two separate doses for full effectiveness.  The interval between the first and second doses is 3 weeks for Pfizer's vaccine and 4 weeks for Moderna's vaccine.  Receiving only the first dose has been shown to provide <50% effectiveness, so getting both doses *of the same vaccine* is critical.

These vaccines do have some side-effects.  Localized pain at the injection site (I've heard it likened to a tetanus shot), fatigue, headache, and muscle/joint pain are the most common, with other cold/flu-like effects also being reported.  All are typically mild and, anecdotally, last no longer than 48 hours.  Reactions seem to be more likely after the second dose than after the first, though this is again anecdotal.

Vaccine distribution occurs through state public health authorities, who allocate the state's shipments to county public health authorities.  In Iowa, those are respectively the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) and Story County Public Health (SCPH).

*****

**ISU Vaccination Status**

Thielen Student Health Center has a vaccine provider agreement with IDPH.  This allows ISU to receive allocations of vaccine from SCPH and to administer vaccinations ourselves.

We received our first allocation the week of December 14th and began vaccinating our healthcare workers that same week ([official release here](https://www.inside.iastate.edu/article/2021/01/07/vaccine)).  Vaccine allocations have been fairly limited and we're still working through those employees (what IDPH terms ""Phase 1a"" recipients).

We do have on-campus ultra-low-temperature storage for vaccine, and we are well-supplied with consumables for mass vaccination when vaccine becomes more widely available.

At this time, vaccination is not widespread enough for us to set aside [the Cyclones Care key protective behaviors](https://www.care.iastate.edu/).  The spring 2021 semester needs to look a lot like the fall 2020 semester.

*****

**What the Future Holds**

At this time, we do not have a firm date for mass availability of vaccine to the general population - including students, faculty, and employees outside of critical infrastructure sectors.  The vaccine rollouts are moving slowly.

Each state sets its own priorities for who gets vaccinated when.  In Iowa, IDPH has designated the first round of vaccine (Phase 1a again) as going to front-line healthcare workers.  Recent guidance set the next round of vaccinations, Phase 1b, as designated for the following groups:

* Persons age 75 or older;
* Persons with disabilities who require home healthcare; 
* Corrections staff and inmates;
* Staff and residents of ""congregate living facilities;""
* Persons involved in workplace settings where workers live in congregate facilities (e.g., bunkroom-style housing for meat/poultry plant workers);
* PK-12 school staff;
* First responders;
* Health, life, and safety inspectors; and
* Government officials critical to continuity of government.

Notably, these categories do not include higher education students (the congregate living category explicitly states, ""College dormitories shall not be included as part of Phase 1B."") or faculty.  Based on this, I expect that most of the people reading this will be eligible for vaccination as part of the general population.  Again, we don't have a firm date for when that will happen.  The *general* guidance we're receiving says that most people who want a vaccine will be able to receive it by summer or fall, which is a pretty vague and wide timeframe.

(Each state is defining its own priorities.  Some states may be putting students in residence halls or higher ed faculty ahead of the general population.  At this time, Iowa is not.  To further confuse the issue, implementation looks different at the local level because each county has different capabilities and needs.  I expect this to generate confusion and stress as vaccination goes on and will continue to share what I know.)

In my time there people found staples and more in their food, servers took food off plates, called patrons disgusting and fat behind their backs, food got left out and tables got forgotten. Servers  and managers were constantly drunk or hungover, some were high

The floors of the kitchen are like gravel amd always full of water, a decent portion of dishes would be sent back out still relatively dirty.

937,Comment,"ICS is, least to say, a piece of shit. I'm not an expert in networking, but ICS seems to discriminate against a computer's IP address within the apartment. My roommates and I considered switching over to Mediacom, as we would go hours not being able to connect to the internet at all and did not want to pay for an upgraded ICS package in case the problems persisted. 

Our solution: VPN. We discovered it when my girlfriend, running a VPN, would come over and have no issues at with the internet on her laptop and wondered what we were complaining about. Once she turned off her VPN, BOOM, internet gone. I don't know how or why it works, but once the VPN is activated, all internet problems on the PC cease to exist (for the most part). I have even got speeds up to 15 Mbps when we're only supposed to get up to 5 Mbps. It's much cheaper than other options as well. privateinternetaccess.com offers a package of $40 per year with up to 5 users.

I am almost inclined to say ICS throttles users and apartments to get them to ""upgrade"" their connections. It's a complete sham, and I hate it. At least I was able to find a solution that's cheap and painless (no more dealing with ISPs). The only problem is that game consoles might still have issues with connections.

962,Comment,"Most seem to be assuming your a student worker, but if you are talking about benefits, it seems, to me, that you are a full time merit employee.

The answer is no. Merit has been approved for a negotiated 1.1% cost of living raise and a 1% raise if you received a satisfactory performance review.

Iowa State is falling substantially behind on wages, and the regents do not show any concern in adjusting. ISU benefits are good, but it does not translate to money in your pocket, and I'm not sure what dining staff make per hour but I assume it is on the low side of the merit pay grades.  The lowest paying merit pay grade is $15/hour, and frankly that is not a living wage in the Ames area.

1007,Comment,"My best class this semester has pre recorded video lectures, and an optional in person or zoom q&a(ie if you want to be there in person you can but you can also zoom in, it‚Äôs also recorded so you can go back to it if needed) Most students join the q&a via zoom so it‚Äôs only like 5 people in a classroom for like 30ish. This model really works well because it gives a consistent time to check in and make class announcements plus it gives the most flexibility for a variety of student needs. 

A university wide understanding that students cheat is important right now. Before cheaters just paid for their mistakes come exam time but now this isn‚Äôt the case. A signed pledge at the top of a take home exam is like a bartender instead of IDing asking people if they‚Äôre 21. Either use the lock down camera browser thing or make it open note, I prefer the later because it‚Äôs a lot less hassle. Right now it feels like all the scores represent is a students lack of honesty. 

In my opinion for ‚ÄúCovid school‚Äù the keys for success are clarity, consistency, and flexibility. 

Clarity: Professors need to make expectations clear this includes things like showing grading rubrics for project, having practice problems with worked out answers, and spelling out when things are due. 

Consistency: professors should do the best they can to have things due at a consistent times and keep consistent schedules. if you  have a weekly quiz make it due the same time every week, don‚Äôt have it due on Sunday then Saturday then on Monday same goes for homework. Getting into a ‚Äúrhythm‚Äù where students know what they‚Äôll be doing and know what to expect can help them feel less burnt out. 

Flexibility: (maybe understanding is a better word idk) professors are just as clueless as students sometimes in this situation. school wasn‚Äôt meant to be online so having flexibility and the ability to pivot if needed is key. Understanding that even student who do the reading aren‚Äôt gonna learn the same amount as a they would from a lecture.  There are a wide variety of student needs right now so being flexible is a must. Also don‚Äôt make exams 7 hours long it‚Äôs cruel. 

Lastly winter sucks and covid sucks, so making February 2021 not the most extremely sucky thing ever is a win.

1037,Comment,"Sorry that someone was that discourteous to you, OP. Most ISU sidewalks prohibit cyclists for good reason; and on the multi-use paths (which do exist!), cyclists should remember what it's like to be a vulnerable road user and be sure to take due care and attention when passing pedestrians.

That being said, when cyclists are surveyed about why they ride on sidewalks, it's because they feel unsafe on the road. And who can blame them? Every behaviour that's being complained about in this thread is something I see drivers do on a near-daily basis.

Since Monday I've had: two drivers try to squeeze me off the road because they couldn't finish their pass before a stop sign; one driver blow a stop sign to turn right, cutting me off while I was making a left turn; multiple drivers stop well past the stop line, blocking pedestrians crossing at intersections; and drivers failing to stop for pedestrians in a marked crosswalk when the pedestrians were halfway across the street!

It's good that you made this post, OP; many people don't realize that most sidewalks on ISU property prohibit cyclists, and even if they did allow cyclists, pedestrians deserve to feel safe while using the sidewalk.

1039,Post,"The females on this campus are out of control. The first time I ate lunch wearing my Iowa State Engineering shirt I had literally 3 different women try to sit down and court me, like I would know how to talk to a girl. I quickly demonstrated superior knowledge of each of their niche interests, which apparently eliminates me from the dating pool (why shame me for being smart?).

Anyway, that got them to leave but the problem has persisted in the past 2 months and I am so fed up with everybody wanting to get with me. I've taken to moving all the other chairs at tables I sit at to other tables, but yesterday a small asian woman literally pulled up a chair and began ranting about the last weekly CS 344 programming ""project"". Girl, I don't struggle with projects that are just homework. I'm an ENG major, not CS. After making it markedly clear that I did NOT in fact want to copulate against the glass walls of the SIC, she finally left me alone, but I wish these girls would stop worshipping me just because I am enrolled in the hardest program on campus (which was not difficult for me to get into, by the way).

The worst are when students from non-technical majors talk to me. We'll be having a nice, platonic conversation, when they inevitably ask the fateful question: ""What's your major?"" As soon as I say my magnificent degree, I see their whole demeanor change. The doe eyes, the flushed cheeks, the jiggling cleavage. What makes a business major think they have a chance with me. Engineering and something practically Liberal Arts are on whole different planes of existence. I'm not about to impregnate somebody that does drop shipping for ""work.""

You may think I'm just remarkably handsome, which I am, but my attractive acquaintances in ‚ÄúEngineering‚Äù Technology (they're not smart enough to be friends, but their childlike innocence is sometimes enviable), have literally no problems with this incessant harassment and courting from female creatures with their ‚ÄòGirl Themed Parties‚Äô. Females see me as an object and a genius, when really I'm so much more: I'm top 100 in War Thunder. My engineering shirt shouldn't reduce me to a bag of meat; if you want my heart, you have to grind with me, raid with me, join my clan, and most of all, watch Star Wars with me, and understand it -- no fake fans that shout ""Luke - I am your father!"" like its some kind of joke, when it's really the climax of the most tragic moment in Star Wars: Episode V ‚Äì The Empire Strikes Back. Not that I cried.

If you want somebody for cheap sex, the business majors are right there (I don't blame you for avoiding non-war profiting business types though). Stop fetishizing my kind for something out of our control. I didn't want to be born a super genius. Hell, sometimes I wish I was a business major, moving through the world in ignorant bliss. But I have a responsibility now to save the world and create the next nuclear powered, hypersonic airplane spaceship (a continuance of Project METEOR obviously). Seductively touching my umbrella isn't going to make me want to get with you.

1054,Post,"At least in my experience First Property Management has been awful beyond belief. This serves as a warning to those looking for apartments. I went through them last year and really regret it.

When I moved into my apartment all of the Windows were open with water having covered parts of things. The apartment itself was really obviously not inspected or was damaged during the summer. Blatant things like a door stop ripped off of a door, a string for blinds that was in the middle of the living room. We didn't have working internet for about a month and even after we finally did things broke a while down because the cable jack wasn't installed correctly.

More than the apartment itself, FPM has been awful to deal with. One time they came to do fireplace inspections. When I came back to my apartment at midnight I was completely locked out because the maintenance worker had apparently ripped the key out of the door and broke the mechanism. The emergency maintenance worker was unavailable until the next day and even then he didn't respond to my message until I called him a second time. There was another time when pipes blocked up and my sink and dish washer filled with sewer water. This time someone luckily came in a few hours to fix it.

Come time to move out they try to get more money from you stating your carpets must be professionally cleaned with a receipt or you can do their ""special"" where instead they just take $100 off your deposit. I am still fighting to actually get my deposit since they sent it a month late to the wrong address (I came in once I got back to Ames to change the address since they hadn't sent it out for some reason). Even now they are stating they can only give me my deposit if they receive the check back from the wrong address they sent it to.

For your own sake, avoid them at all costs. Maybe you'll have a better experience but if mine is indicative of how they act you'll be in for a ride.",15,20,0.84,51h8ed,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/51h8ed/you_should_avoid_first_property_management/

‚Ä¢ Somerset for a nice place to walk. It was intended to be another downtown environment, but most businesses are just financial services or clinics. However, The Cafe, Wallaby's, Brick Town, and El Azteca are all successful local restaurants worth visiting

‚Ä¢ Campus is a great place to walk, see interesting architecture, find lots of public art funded by the Iowa Public Art For Public Buildings initiative, go to 3 great museums,, watch wildlife at Lake Laverne, go to live music events at the Memorial Union, go to college sports events, and enjoy the beauty of the four seasons, especially in April and October 

‚Ä¢ Reiman Gardens for the indoor tropical butterfly enclosure, conservatory- especially during winter, the wonderful 12 or so different gardens with noticeable changes throughout the year, awesome events for Christmas and Halloween, and excellent rotating sculpture displays 

‚Ä¢ Throughout town is a great bike trail system, part of the central Iowa trails. The trails connect most parts of the town and its parks system, which is also worth visiting for places like Ada Hayden Lake, Tedesco Environmental Learning Corridor, Moore Memorial Park, North River Valley Park at the whitewater rapids, and Inis Grove Park 

‚Ä¢ Story County has lots of hiking trails, especially along the Skunk River Greenbelt. McFarland Park is quite nice, even found a natural 4' waterfall there. Most are managed by Story County Conservation, but even in Ames, public land for hiking can be found at Pammel Woods, Munn Woods, and Reactor Woods. Please treat these areas well if you go

‚Ä¢ Lockwood Cafe and Reliable St are totally a hidden gem, with tons of artwork and cool graffiti on all sides of the building inside and out, an indoor skate ramp upstairs at WeCycle, great events like open mic night, outdoor movie showings, and they even had a passenger rail event to Boone. The surrounding grounds also have a small children‚Äôs garden, really unique wooden play feature designed by architecture students, free community garden on a first come first serve basis, and free thrift store",10,72,0.99,1b5g6q6,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/1b5g6q6/things_to_do_and_hidden_gems_in_ames/

1066,Comment,"Lot to get through here. As for books, I don't tend to think there is a universal book that everyone should read. For a math-type book, Concrete Mathematics is a great choice, but you are already seeing my biases come out as some mathematicians would not like that selection. I do think it is important to read, and I recently have taken over the [Ron Graham archives](https://www.rongraham.org/ron-graham/archives). Which has literally over a thousand books in mathematics and all sorts of odds and ends. It will take me the next few years to work my way through it. So my recommendations are to find books that interest you, that make you happy, that inspire you, and to read those books.

As to my 20's and 30's, the main thing that I would do differently is to try and get out more, to meet more people, and to be more brave. I am by nature an extreme introvert and one of the least out-going people you might ever meet. So it is incredibly difficult for me to make friends and put myself into new situations. For me that was and is OK, because in the meantime I was great at math and could do lots of mathematics and excel at it and be recognized for how good I was at doing mathematics and teaching mathematics. But (and this gets to the fourth question) the thing is that ***no matter what field you are in, at the end you are working with people, and it does matter who you know***. I was very lucky in my life to meet Ron Graham and Fan Chung and to become good friends with them, and they became family to me and through them I was able to get the connections I needed to succeed and end up with the job I have here at Iowa State. Without that connection I would probably be teaching college algebra at some small community college for the next thirty years. So my advice: ***find a way to connect with people and make friends; step out of your comfort zone and get to know people. The connections you make, big and small, will help you out later in life. And while we are at it, treat everyone with respect and dignity***.

That leaves us with one question. So I am going to preface this by saying that it was not a ""negative experience"", more of a ""neutral experience"" but one that I would not wish to repeat and contributed significantly to changing who I am. (There are also many other experiences as well which I would repeat which changed me, so I do not want to imply that this is the fulcrum of my life.) So I grew up as a Mormon, though not a particularly good one (that said, to this day I have yet to drink any alcohol, coffee, or even Coca-Cola), and as many Mormons do I spent two years out knocking on doors. There were days which were miserable weather, and days which were beautiful, lots of frustration and people not wanting to talk to me (understandably), and the occasional friendly face. On the whole it was a mixture of experiences, good and bad which is why I say it was a neutral experience; and certainly one that I would not repeat. In the end I learned a lot of things, which had a change on me. Two of the things that I learned are ***patience and listening***; I find these useful even today.",1,8,,i6qqq0,t1_g0ycyus,/r/iastate/comments/i6qqq0/ama_with_the_calculus_coordinator_steve_butler/g0yka10/

1074,Post,"Hey iastate.

I thought I'd post this here since it is a pretty location specific question.

I have a Windows 7 Desktop and Windows 7 Laptop.  My desktop resides in Friley, where I live.  It has a public IP address in the 65.110.x.x block.

Here's the deal.  I want to be able to access files from my desktop on my laptop easily, so I shared the hard drive on my desktop that has my personal files on it (with proper security, of course).  I then went to Map a Network Drive on my laptop and attempted to add the share.  The Desktop never responds, and it fails.

This is curious to me, as I am able to RDP my desktop from my laptop from ANYWHERE on the Internet (since it has a public IP).  I have already tested this and know that it works.

However, even when I'm in the same building, I can't access the shared files.  **Does anyone know if ITS has some sort of port blocking going on to make Windows Sharing Disabled?**

1128,Post,"Hello all!

I apologize for the late post here, I've been swamped at work with all the changes and full time class. But anyway, let's get you what you need to know about CyRide!

**DETOURS**

The ridiculous detour that we had to use due to Union, Bissell, Wallace, and Wallace & University being closed is DONE. Construction has been ""completed,"" (lol) so our buses can actually get through. If you're at Friley/Student services, the bus stops are still open; however there are no shelters or benches at the moment. Please be patient while we work on installing them.

Unfortunately, there are still detours, however due to the length of them they have been added into the schedule. The main detour due to Wallace closure / Gerdin expansion affects routes #3 Blue, #21 Cardinal, & #23 Orange.  They will follow what shows on the [System Map here](https://www.cyride.com/Home/ShowDocument?id=9463). Note that blue only goes in a clockwise direction around campus, Cardinal goes down Morrill and will NOT go in front of the MU, and Orange has to follow plum route to get to Lincoln Way. To answer the inevitable question about #21 and why it doesn't follow Beach to Union in front of the presidents house, there are two reasons:
* Our 40' buses cannot make the right hand turn from Lincoln Way onto Union safely.
* Even if we could follow that route, the Cardinals would be so late that you wouldn't even want to ride it. We're talking permanent 15 minute delays and trips missed in their entirety if we went that route (no pun intended.)

Now onto temporary detours. The only temporary detour in effect should be the Westbound #1 Red, #7 Purple, #11 Cherry, and #12 Lilac detour [seen here](https://www.cyride.com/home/showdocument?id=9834) (you may need to zoom in for it.)

This detour is relatively minor and shouldn't affect much on campus. It is due to construction at Lincoln Way and Hyland and our buses being unable to complete the right hand turn safely. Even if there is no road work being done around it at times, we will continue the detour until the work there is completed for the sake of consistency.

**Technology**

CyRide has decided to end our contract with NextBus and work with a company called Syncromatics instead to better suit our customers needs and ADA compliance. If you're experiencing any issues, please be patient during this transition; we expect most of the bugs to be worked out in the coming months. Schedule time should still be relatively accurate, but pay specific attention on days that we're not in service (Labor Day, for example) and Break weeks, as both Nextbus and Syncromatics both seem to struggle to provide accurate predictions during those times. If you're unsure, please take a look at our [printed schedules](https://www.cyride.com/schedules) online. These are what the drivers use to maintain their times along routes and are by far the most accurate if you're trying to plan a trip.

You might notice that drivers now have tablets in their buses. This might not affect you, but if you're curious that is where the GPS signal is coming from. 

**Talking buses**

For safety reasons, ADA requirements, and technology improvements, we have made the step to install automatic stop annunciators in the entire CyRide fleet. We will no longer be announcing which routes you can transfer to; however the annunciator will announce more stops along route. We're still in the process of working out the bugs on this as well, and if you're riding an ""extra"" bus the driver may have to announce them manually.

**Hiring**

If you want to make $16.07 an hour for an incredibly easy job, please apply. It's really not as hard as you would think to drive a bus. We have a ton of hours open, specifically our nights and weekends. I've been driving a LOT this week when I'm usually in the office. We aren't kidding when we say that we're hiring!

CyRide also offers PAID vacation, sick leave, IPERS retirement account (I have like $8000 in mine, it's pretty great) and will guarantee off school related events. If you do apply, make sure to say **Mike the Dispatcher** referred you. I'll get $500 if you do become a driver!

**Policy**

Some of you may not be aware of it, but we did implement policy changes last year to keep the buses running consistently. Traditionally, if someone was late to the bus we would wait for them. This is no longer the case, so if you miss your bus you might have to wait for the next one. I know it might not seem like a big deal for the driver to wait for one person, but one person turns into two, and then two turns into four that are all late for the bus and then the bus leaves late from it's stop. This affects everyone down the line that was at the stop on time, sometimes waiting in the cold or rain. Generally we try to be more lenient about this policy on weekends or trips where buses are more infrequent, but it is up to driver discretion. If the driver *does* decide to wait for you, please hustle!

Another policy we implemented was no guaranteed transfers on campus until 6pm on weekdays. With the frequency of service, there are plenty of routes that come by every 2-3 minutes that will get you to the same place. After 6pm on weekdays and all day on weekends, transfers within 2 minutes will be guaranteed. 

Another policy that has always been in place is to show your ISU ID for fixed route buses. Some students might not be aware when and when they don't have to show their ID, which can be confusing. The best rule of thumb is if the bus route starts with a ""20"", you don't have to show your ID. So for routes #21 Cardinal, #23 Orange, and #25 Gold, you don't need to show the driver your ID because anyone can ride them without payment. All others routes please make sure that you have your ID ready when boarding the bus. This is again something that might not seem like a big deal individually, but we also have members of the public that spend hundreds of dollars to purchase an annual pass. If they see that other people get by without showing ID, it is frustrating for them. 

If you lose your ID or are working on getting a replacement, just tell the driver that when you board. They will let you ride, no problem, until you get your ID replaced. 

That should be it folks! Let me know if you have any questions about anything and I'd be happy to answer. Have fun riding CyRide!",13,101,1.0,cx1sz0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/cx1sz0/its_that_time_of_year_again_cyride_info_new_gps/

[The full video is here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcztaLqigyE).  It's about 80 minutes long, so I've compiled a TL;DW (which itself is too long anyway, but this was very information-dense).  This is a good summary of the current state of the pandemic from a local expert.

All errors in transcription and communication are mine.

-----

**Pandemic Status**

Some interesting data visualization to start off:

Nationally, we've had four waves so far.  The first and smallest was in March-April 2020.  The second, larger one was July 2020.  The third and, so far, largest started climbing in October and peaked around the first of the year.  Its subsidence in February isn't attributable to vaccination because we didn't have enough vaccine in circulation yet to make a difference.  Where we do see effects correlating with vaccination are in the fourth wave, which began in March but stayed more-or-less steady before fading away in April.  This suggests that transmission started decreasing because vaccination was working.

Mapping county-level deaths per capita shows interesting differences between states.  Iowa had many more deaths per capita than Minnesota, Illinois, Missouri, and Nebraska.  

Taking the same map down to the Iowa level, Story and Johnson had the lowest deaths per capita in Iowa.  That may be a reflection of large populations of young, healthy students who didn't get very sick.
Our peak COVID hospitalizations in mid-November were 1,510.  Thus week, we're at 68.

Statewide, 60% of deaths were in ages 80+.  Another 22% were ages 70-79 and 13% in ages 60-69.  Deaths in the 0-17 and 18-29 groups rounded to 0%.

MGMC has had 590 COVID patients discharged and 59 deaths.  Something that none of the inpatient and death data captures is the large number of patients MGMC had through the first half of this year who were hospitalized due to lingering complications from COVID infections they had in October-December 2020.

-----

**Vaccines**

Scientific studies are always controlled for variables, so there's some expectation of different real-world performance.  Following controlled trials and mass vaccination rollouts, we now have a lot more real-world safety data.  Israel has nationalized healthcare and gave Pfizer full data access in exchange for more vaccine doses.  What that data shows is that the vaccines worked just as well as they did in the controlled trials: 90% decrease in onset of COVID cases, very few hospitalizations or deaths.

Epidemiological surveillance of patients post-vaccination was done to see if vaccinated people were getting COVID and just didn't know it.  Lots of nose-swabbing revealed very little unexpected infection.  Very low rates of symptomatic and asymptomatic infection in vaccinated populations.

How about the 10% of vaccinated people who can still get COVID?  Are they still contagious?  What we're seeing is that those people are much less contagious than unvaccinated people.  Viral loads in those vaccinated people are much lower.  Studies in England show 40-60% reduction in contagiousness.

Antibody levels are higher post-vaccine than post-infection.  Vaccine provides better protection than natural immunity gained after having COVID.  Vaccine also provides better protection against reinfection from different variants.

-----

**Vaccine Longevity and Boosters**

How long are the vaccines going to last?  Long-term surveillance of the initial trial participants show that after 6 months, only a mild decrease in antibodies occurred.  There is some age-dependent decrease ‚Äì the people who lost the most antibodies after 6 months are 65+.  One-year data on this cohort is due out soon.  This will help determine whether we need boosters in the future.  

Two factors in determining whether we'll need vaccine booster shots are (a) how long does immunity last? and (b) what are the COVID variants doing?  Vaccine is effective against currently-known variants.

-----

**Vaccine Safety**

310 million doses of Pfizer dispensed so far; 5,343 reports of deaths.  A lot of those 310 million people were already very old, very sick, or very medically vulnerable; deaths in those groups are expected from unrelated causes every day.  Statistically, ""This may have occurred if we had given out 310 million coloring books.""  

J&J blood clot issue is similar to autoimmune conditions involving low platelet counts.  36 cases out of 11.7 million doses dispensed.  Linked to exceptionally rare genetic factor.

The monitoring process is working well and identifying even literal one-in-a-million events.  Long-term studies are monitoring the original recipients and no ""signals of weirdness"" have been observed.

No increase in negative pregnancy outcomes observed in vaccine recipients.

-----

**Pediatric COVID**

Younger patients rarely get very sick.  Early pandemic data showed 2.5% of patients in the 10-19 age range had symptoms severe enough to require hospitalization.  Breaking that age cohort out between those with and without underlying health conditions shows 15% hospitalization for those with underlying conditions and 2.2% for those without.  Death rates are around 0.1% chance for overall age cohort but ~5% for those with underlying health conditions.

Research on previous vaccines (strep) showed a correlation between vaccination of pediatric patients and a reduction of severe infection rates in elderly patients.  Vaccinating younger patients helps everyone around them.

-----

**Vaccination Progress**

Current status in Iowa tracks directly with age.  Age 18-19 32% fully vaccinated, age 20-30 35%.  Age 65+ at 80%.  Story County is 48.9% overall, with 93% of age 65+ fully vaccinated.

-----

**Masks**

Multiple studies show masks are effective.  They aren't 100% effective but they certainly aren't useless ‚Äì effect across those studies seems to be ~70% reduction in transmission.

Staying in a virus-rich environment (e.g., home care with infected family member coughing all over you, AJ's Ultralounge, 801 Day) offsets much of the benefit you get from masking.  Best benefit offered in well-ventilated spaces or spaces where you don't spend a lot of time.

Mask recommendations a year ago were made with limited data.  The science has evolved over the past year because we've had a lot larger data set.

For outdoor use ‚Äì very crowded environments (e.g., football) still have a risk of transmission but otherwise there is relatively little risk.

Masks still recommended in healthcare settings because of close contact with sick patients, increased percentage of immunocompromised and high-risk populations, and possibility of an emerging variant that vaccines aren't effective against.  Also, healthcare settings see lots of other non-COVID respiratory infections that masks can mitigate.

We do still have immunocompromised people in the community.  One argument for continuing mask use is to help normalize mask use to support them.

-----

**What's Next?**

Response overall is moving from public health/mass care to personal responsibility.  

Expect an increase in cases among unvaccinated people in the fall due to changes in weather and people moving back indoors.  How bad will it get?  That depends on how many people are vaccinated and what the emerging COVID variants do.

Personal responsibility does tie back to community responsibility.  If we can get another 10-20% of the population vaccinated before fall, we will see significant benefits.  Please help encourage and normalize it.  Deciding to vaccinate yourself may save your neighbor's life.

Metaphors are good.  Vaccines are like pants.  If you don't wear them, you might feel like you wish you had.  They're good even if they are made by large evil corporations.  Pants aren't explicitly required in many places but they're still a good idea.",14,38,0.89,o7pqxw,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/o7pqxw/mgmcmcfarland_june_22_covid_town_hall_summary/

I don't know who is teaching Math 492, but I am confident they will do a good job.

As for what I am teaching in the spring, it will probably be math of juggling which will be aimed at a 200 level math class with some very basic proofs in it.

1192,Comment,"This: 
 ""make full use of the ISU Career Management Services site""
Extremely useful.  

Just checked, the link is: https://cyhire.iastate.edu/students/

Anyway, I highly recommend taking full advantage of that site. I went to nearly every engineering career fair while I was at ISU, which was definitely worthwhile. However, I don't think I ever received an interview solely from face to face networking at the career fair, but I had at least 10 first round interviews throughout the semesters which were a direct result of applying to job listings on the CMS site.

 The interview process for my current full time job got started because I was accepted for a first round interview that I applied for on CMS. It actually wasn't one of the companies I stopped to visit during the career fair. 

I am by no means saying you shouldn't go to the career fair. I learned a lot about different companies, and perhaps most importantly, got experience talking to and networking with recruiters. I think, though, that for myself, my work experience and leadership experience upon a well crafted resume sold me a lot better than my presence at the career fair. I'm somewhat soft-spoken and always felt I had far more success in the more personal and relaxed environments of a 1:1 interview or a company info session than in the hubbub of the career fair.

Also of note:
*Use the CMS website to find or confirm company info sessions. These may or may not be around the time of the career fair. Often they're more into October. Personally, I got a lot more out of attending a bunch of these than the career fairs and it was through these that I feel I learned the most about the different companies I was interested in.

*Become active in your major's student organization(s). As a Computer Engineer I was active in IEEE and IASG which led to discovering an abundance of companies coming to give talks (+pizza! +freebies!) to students. Plus, anytime a company representative is in the same room as you is a great chance to network, give them your resume, learn more about the company, etc - a lot like the career fair, except more personal.

*Take advantage of the info sessions and workshops surrounding the career fair. Often ""practice"" networking sessions or mock interviews may be available (you can ask Engineering Career Services to schedule these on your own too, I believe).

Both companies are looking for both full time and interns, both companies are looking for hardware and software related engineers. 

Garmin International will be in Coover 2245 at 5:10. They are located in Kansas City and make lots of products in the fields of aviation, automotive, fitness, marine, and outdoor. All interns at Garmin live in free apartments provided by Garmin and all employees receive lots of great benefits.

Texas Instruments will be in Coover 3043 at 6:30. Located in Dallas, TX, they are most famous for their calculators, but that's only a small portion of their market. They do a lot of work with new computer chips, semiconductors, and transistors. If you break open any electronic device, you'll most likely see Texas Instruments somewhere inside.

Both sessions will serve free food for all attendees. Come get dinner at 5:10 and learn how to land an interview at Garmin tomorrow, then stay to learn more about Texas Instruments! ",0,3,0.8,70v61n,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/70v61n/free_food_precareer_fair_company_presentations/

Dude, I'm the one saying to buy cheap groceries rather than use dining dollars to buy snacks. You're advice is to buy more dining dollars, which costs more.

>There's a ton more that goes into grocery shopping when you live in a dorm

The only difficult thing is getting a fridge in your apartment, but that's not even hard. How is buying apples, nuts, yogurt and eating them so hard?

>Jimmy Johns and having it delivered to you

again, fast food is bad for you. Jimmy Johns has a lot of bread and processed meat. Also, I thought you liked variety, and that was one reason you hated the UDCC? Jimmy Johns is not that much cheaper than a meal at the UDCC, either. (going on the $7.43 meal).

You may not be aware of this, but the first advise financially struggling people often get is to not buy fast food. Fast food is usually much more expensive than buying groceries and cooking yourself, contrary to what you would think.

""The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences"" is the title of an article published in 1960 by the physicist Eugene Wigner. In the paper, Wigner observed that the mathematical structure of a physical theory often points the way to further advances in that theory and even to empirical predictions.

1256,Post,"Hello, yesterday we had a professional development session with 4 HR managers across the companies in our corp. I learned a lot of good tips that would be useful for anyone here, and coming from people who are doing the hiring, I thought it would add some value.

**Prior to interview**

*Research company.* HR said they hate questions like ""What does your company do"". Said it shows lack of caring, and if you actually want to work there you would look into the company.

*Review job description* HR said that you should be able to at least reflect some of the tasks within your scope of work (either from your resume or at your interview). Said they constantly see people say they're proficient in something, only to actually know very little things. Kept saying honesty in your resume and interview.

*Research individuals interviewing you.* HR said they are all ""talkative people that like to have conversations"". Said if you find a personal connection, it truly helps you stick out.  Research the interviewer on linkedin, find a common connection (interest, school, likes etc). 

*Practice for questions*. HR mentioned STAR alot (Situation, Task, Action, Result). Said to take a second or to just to stop and think before you start rambling about something. Said candidates go minutes off track but don't actually answer it. Also said please write down stuff, like commonly asked questions, just so you can help yourself. You can always use notes they said. Also quantify everything. Instead of saying ""I cashed a lot of checks at my bank teller job"" say "" I cashed over $2 million dollars worth in checks at my bank teller job."" Numbers=results. 

*Prepare questions to ask interviewer*. HR said one of the biggest turn offs is when a candidate doesn't have questions. Said it shows their character of either not wanting to learn, or not having creative thinking. Ask questions to drive conversation. HR said, as I stated above, they love having conversations because that's the scope of their job.  Said ask at least 1-2 job related questions, and 1 ""personal"" question (How did you hear about job xxyz, What's your favorite thing about xxyz, etc..). 

*Dress professionally* The first thing they see is you, and how you dress reflects it. Dress as nice as you can, wrinkle free as well.  Even if they mention ""casual fridays"" and your interview is on Friday, still dress as best you can. 

*Be on time*. HR said it bugs them when someone is late, since they have busy schedules. Said show up at least 15 minutes. On site interviews may require signing in, parking far away, walking a good distance. HR said it's better to show up super early, wait in your car, then go in 15 minutes early. Being on time is a big factor in showing your character as a worker.

**During the interview**

*Project confidence* firm handshake, smile, eye contact. HR said smiling and eye contact is a big key for them. They want you to be someone they would work with. Good eye contact helps you stick out. Smiling naturally makes you sound more 'joyful'.

*Posture* Don't move around, fidget your hands, chew gum etc. HR said 1 candidate was chewing gum and that HR was so distracted by it, they didn't consider them. 

**Other tips**

* Ask to connect via Linked in. HR said Linked in is used by almost everyone, and it's a good way to stick out. Said emails are fine, but some may be filtered. Said never send a physical letter

* Cover letters. HR said they rarely read cover letters (95% of the time). Said don't take too long on it, however doesn't mean make it lazy. Don't repeat what is on your resume, but expand on it

*Resumes. Add only relevant information. Said preferred size is 1 page, after 2 pages gets ""long"" and may not read. Quantify everything. No spelling typos, grammar issues, etc. Said the average HR person looks at a resume for 6 seconds before they either consider or toss it out. Formatting is key.

* Social media - Said they don't check facebook (most work places block facebook), however still keep it professional. HR said 1 candidate tweeted ""F this [part time]job, I'm going to get high"". Immediately rejected. They will see what you say, even if they don't search it right away. Keep Linked in 100% professional. Showed us a screenshot of someones picture with beer cans up to his ears, automatic no. Professional pictures preferred.

* Said linked in is the best to connect.

* Said it's best to directly apply from their website, indeed/other 3rd party services may have a fee to the company. Directly on the website is already in the ERP

Any other questions you may have I can think if they answered them, they went over a lot (2 hours) worth of topics and I'm sure I didn't remember a lot of them in this post",3,62,0.96,92csgi,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/92csgi/had_a_professional_development_session_about_the/

1) The other desserts that the dining hall had weren‚Äôt as popular and they have extra to get through instead of producing scotcharoos and wasting. Or they didn‚Äôt order enough from the bakery to provide for entirety of service. (Forecasting who what when is pretty hit and miss sometimes)

2) production/costing issues. Every semester management and chefs look at budgets and cut things and or replace to make sure budget is made. 

3) It just wasn‚Äôt on the spring menu. 

It may not be an instantaneous response but provide feedback to Dining services either via social media or find  the managers/directors email and let them know your feelings. In my experience (it‚Äôs been a few years since working there) management is pretty responsive to feedback. May take time to work back into menu, or they‚Äôll find out why they aren‚Äôt being served.

I mean, say you get 14 meals a week. Are you going to want to spend $9 on a breakfast? I'm going to assume you don't. And on days you do spend $9 on breakfast, you probably don't want to spend $9 on lunch and $9 on dinner as well.


So we're left with 14 meals, lunch and dinner. Every meal you eat somewhere away from the dining center is then like wasting $9 on top of what you paid for the meal. 

I never met one person in Friley or MWL or anywhere that got too few meals and complained about not having enough swipes. People were giving away swipes like candy at the end of the semester. So many people had an insane amount they didn't use. 


And C-Stores are open at least a couple hours later than any place that serves real full meals for meal bundles, but they don't have much for actual meals that late from what I remember. Of course that could be different now.

Introduction

Iowa State University is a world-class institution, known for its excellent academic programs, vibrant campus community, and beautiful campus. However, one area where ISU could improve is in the availability of dining options for students. Currently, the campus dining centers are located in various buildings, making it difficult for students to access them quickly and easily.

To address this issue, we propose the addition of a new dining center on top of the Campanile, called the Camp-a-Meal. The Campanile is a well-known and iconic landmark on the ISU campus, and its central location would make it an ideal location for a dining center. The Camp-a-Meal would provide students with a convenient, unique, and appealing dining option, while also enhancing the use and visibility of the Campanile.

Background

The Campanile is a 277-foot tall bell tower that is located in the heart of the ISU campus. Built in 1912, the Campanile is one of the oldest and most recognized buildings on campus. It currently serves as a carillon and is open to the public for tours.

The Campanile has a spacious observation deck on its top level, offering panoramic views of the campus and surrounding area. However, this space is currently underutilized, with only a few benches and a small museum exhibit.

Adding the Camp-a-Meal dining center to the top of the Campanile would provide a unique and appealing dining option for students, while also enhancing the use and visibility of the Campanile. The Camp-a-Meal would offer a variety of food options, including healthy and sustainable options, to cater to the diverse tastes of ISU students.",8,35,0.96,zjc8yf,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/zjc8yf/asked_chatgpt_to_write_a_proposal_for_the/

Source: I am a transportation planner and currently focused on transit (bus, regional bus, rail, light rail, etc)

The goal would be to both maximize connectivity between highly traveled areas as well as not impeding traffic too much as to cause other issues in the city. This design does a decent job but I would change a few things. 

For one, I would take out the stop at Jack trice and go further south toward Ames Fitness. Or, alternatively go more west where there are a lot of residential areas. When folks go to the stadium for games usually they park in grass lots near by and it's a short walk over. Im not sure how many folk would actually use that part of the route (the MPO's travel demand model could tell us this but I don't have access to that).

Two, I wouldn't have the light rail go along Lincoln Way. That road is already full of traffic and it's a 4 lane without any spacing between opposing directions (and land locked unless you want to declare eminent domain on the properties to expand it to both keep travel lanes and add in a new LRT line). 

Not a bad effort that's for sure! A few tweaks and maybe some additional lines would be cool.",0,9,,16kim4s,t3_16kim4s,/r/iastate/comments/16kim4s/lrt_system_for_isu_and_ames/k0z9pjo/

For example, if you are in engineering, you can go to engineering computer labs and only use 1 credit/page for black and white.  Whereas going to, say, a residence hall computer lab will use 7 units/page.  Additionally, some colleges/departments do not charge their students for printing - business for example (at least the last I knew).

Check out this page for a searchable list of computer labs.  It will tell you how many units it takes to print there and if there are any restrictions.

If you are still having trouble finding friends, there's a speed friending event at the ames public library on Feb 8 from 2-4. Otherwise join some clubs or got to other events like the movies or isu after dark. Join study groups or SI sessions. Do some classes at the gym, bond over almost dying from a class and looking like a drowned rat. Get a job on campus, half my coworkers are in the same college as me, so we usually have something to talk about.¬†
If you live with roommates who have been here last semester, ask them to introduce you to some people or groups they are apart of.",0,1,,1i7l3t2,t3_1i7l3t2,/r/iastate/comments/1i7l3t2/i_still_need_friends/m8v92pv/

1430,Comment,"I go to ISU now, but when I first came to the US as an F1 student I went to Community College in Florida. I got my U.S ID there right after arriving. 

Now, an ID is different than a drivers license. For the ID I literally showed up to the tax collector with 3 proofs of residence, my i94, passport with F1 visa, and i20. They take your picture and that‚Äôs it. You get your ID. 

The ID is useful solely for the purpose of an identification card. You‚Äôll use it when signing a lease document, going to the bank, etc etc. 

My drivers license I got years later, when I was looking into buying a car. First, I took the computer-based exam (took it twice the same day bc I didn‚Äôt pass it the first time lol).  You walk out of the DMV with your temporary learner‚Äôs license, which lets you drive in the streets with some constraints (you have to always be accompanied by a licensed adult and you can‚Äôt drive past a certain hour at night). I believe it also lets you drive alone if you are going to school or something like that, each state has its rules so I would look further into that. 

Once you take the actual driving exam and pass it, they take your picture again and then you‚Äôre able to drive without restrictions. 

I also had my home country‚Äôs drivers license and I didn‚Äôt use it as a waiver for the computer-based test, I‚Äôm not sure if you can do that. Call the DMV and ask. 

Best luck!!",0,4,,el8d5s,t3_el8d5s,/r/iastate/comments/el8d5s/getting_a_driving_license_as_an_international/fdhc68h/

1432,Post,"Hey iastate.

I thought I'd post this here since it is a pretty location specific question.

I have a Windows 7 Desktop and Windows 7 Laptop.  My desktop resides in Friley, where I live.  It has a public IP address in the 65.110.x.x block.

Here's the deal.  I want to be able to access files from my desktop on my laptop easily, so I shared the hard drive on my desktop that has my personal files on it (with proper security, of course).  I then went to Map a Network Drive on my laptop and attempted to add the share.  The Desktop never responds, and it fails.

This is curious to me, as I am able to RDP my desktop from my laptop from ANYWHERE on the Internet (since it has a public IP).  I have already tested this and know that it works.

However, even when I'm in the same building, I can't access the shared files.  **Does anyone know if ITS has some sort of port blocking going on to make Windows Sharing Disabled?**

Any help would be much appreciated.",5,7,0.9,dkckv,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/dkckv/windows_sharing_problems/

As always, I am not an official ISU spokesperson.  For the most recent official COVID updates from ISU, always refer to [the COVID-19 Moving Forward page on iastate.edu](https://web.iastate.edu/safety/updates/covid19).*

*****

Back again.  A lot has changed since the last update in late April.  This will likely be my final large COVID update post for the summer unless the epidemiological landscape undergoes a seismic shift.

*****

**Campus Vaccination Wrap-Up**

We closed down the State Gym mass vax clinic on May 20.  Despite many, many speedbumps with the vaccine supply chain and other factors outside our sphere of influence, the team there saved lives and made history every day.  Our final numbers were 12,279 doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered to 6,794 patients.

I'm still in awe of what the team accomplished during those six weeks.  The whole campus community came together to make it happen.  I went into the planning process convinced we weren't going to be able to get the personnel to make it work.  When the initial call for volunteers went out and every staff slot was filled within 48 hours, I started to believe we might be able to pull it off.  So - thank you to everyone from every unit on campus who stepped forward to make the clinic happen.

Thielen Student Health Center was the heart (and probably the liver) of the operation.  If you were vaccinated at State Gym, though, you may not have gotten your shot from a Thielen healthcare provider.  They have a limited number of clinical staff and we also had to hold some back to keep Thielen open for its full slate of normal healthcare operations.  So the College of Veterinary Medicine, Story County Public Health, Mary Greeley Medical Center, and ISU/Ames Lab Occupational Medicine all came out to help vaccinate.  Special thanks to every one of those groups, especially the newly-graduated veterinarians who got to be called ""Doctor"" for the first time while working with us.

*****

**Vaccine Availability**

At this point, the U.S. domestic supply chain for Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccine formulations appears fairly stable.  Most major pharmacy chains should have sufficient supplies.  I haven't been keeping track of vaccine availability at independent local pharmacies or general practitioners' offices, but I expect it will be available through those over the summer if it isn't already.

Over the last year, we've all had to endure a lot of protective measures.  Those measures were in place because we didn't have a vaccine.  They existed to minimize COVID infections - to reduce the total burden on the healthcare system - until vaccines were available.  The relaxation or removal of those measures was done with the expectation that every responsible adult in the country who is able to receive a vaccine will do so.  Please help make that happen so we don't have a repeat of New York City last spring or Ames after last August's 801 Day.  And if you already have - thank you for being part of the solution instead of part of the problem or part of the landscape.

*****

**What Fall Looks Like**

As I write this, we're 11 weeks away from fall move-in.  A lot can change in that amount of time, as we have seen repeatedly over the last year and a half.  However, several policy changes and clarifications came out on May 20 following a Board of Regents announcement.  *As always, I am not an official ISU spokesperson and my statements do not represent the policy or opinion of ISU leadership or the Board of Regents,* but here's my summary:

* All Regents employees are to return to their primary on-campus work locations no later than July 1, with the exception of 9-month term faculty, who are to return no later than August 19.  That means that when students return, most or all of the usual campus services should be operating at the levels you saw before COVID.  More importantly, parking availability will suck again.

* In-person academics will be offered at the same level that was available prior to the pandemic. 

* ""Traditional student life activities and opportunities"" should also resume this fall.  Please try to keep the property damage down.

* To accommodate the preceding two items, classrooms and other spaces will be back to 100% capacity and physical distancing will not be required.  This does not apply to healthcare, research lab, or veterinary settings.

* Regents universities may not require employees, students, or visitors to wear face coverings.  Again, this does not apply to healthcare, research lab, or veterinary settings.  Note that face coverings are still required on CyRide as a matter of federal policy for public transportation.

* Regents universities may not require employees, students, or visitors to be vaccinated or to provide proof of vaccination.

**Demobilization**

[COVID Day One at ISU was January 27, 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/l6czof/dispatches_from_the_eoc_covid_new_year/).  On March 5, COVID Day 39, we activated ISU's Emergency Operations Center full-time to coordinate and support the university-wide COVID response.

On June 1, COVID Day 492, we demobilized the EOC.  This doesn't mean my team is done with COVID, nor that the university is done with it.  Planning and preparations will continue through the summer and likely into the fall and beyond, until COVID is truly at the point that normal healthcare systems can manage it like any other infectious respiratory disease.  But ISU as an institution is no longer operating at a level that requires the EOC team to provide that level of coordination.  Most of what's happening now is happening at the individual unit/department level, with some guidance from a couple of select committees.

On a personal note: I started working at ISU on April 1, 2019, so after an EOC activation of 454 days, I've spent more time dealing with COVID than I have spent at ISU *not* dealing with COVID.  I've spent more time in the EOC than at my own desk.  Despite having had a couple of weeks to close out our final coordination tasks, this is a jarring transition for me.  I became ISU's Emergency Manager on February 15, 2020, and I haven't really done much with the emergency management program I inherited.  Now I need to figure out what my job looks like and what my staff and I need to focus on going forward.

Thanks for reading.  I'll see you on campus this fall.  When you come back, remember to thank a custodian or a Student Health employee (preferably a few of each).",9,92,1.0,nquwcm,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/nquwcm/dispatches_from_the_eoc_standing_down/

###Welcome/Welcome Back to ISU!

Hello all, welcome/welcome back back to ISU! I hope everyone had a great summer. 

For those of you that don't know me, I'm Mike and I've been with CyRide for almost 9 years now. I started as a driver back in 2015, became a Transit Dispatcher in 2016, became a Transit Trainer in 2022. I'm responsible for onboarding, the early stages of training, and getting trainees their commercial driver's license (CDL.)

I will generally post CyRide updates here each semester to let everyone know what's going on with CyRide and what you can expect for the year. I'll also post updates for any major detours, severe weather, or anything else that might impact service (think 801 day on Saturday, 8/19.)

Since this is a long post, **new riders** skip to the bottom of this post for Rider Tips and Information. There's also a TL;DR at the bottom for the main points of this post.

---


###Fall Schedule

Fall schedule starts today Monday, August 14th, but we will be running a [break schedule](https://www.cyride.com/Home/Components/News/News/3932/1342?backlist=%2f) through Friday, August 18th  since ISU is not in session. If you're looking at a physical printed schedule, the shaded lines on the timetable *do not* operate. The most impacted routes are #9 Plum, #11 Cherry, and #23 Orange, but most routes will have at least a few trips early morning and into the evening that have some sort of impact.

We will be running **full weekend service** on Saturday the 19th and Sunday the 20th due to increased demand. Additionally, Moonlight Express **will** be running on Friday, August 18th and Saturday, August 19th. I will have more details on Moonlight later in this post.

On Monday, August 21st, we will be running full service and all shaded lines in the printed timetable will run pretty much until Thanksgiving Break. 

---

###Route updates for #23 Orange and #9 Plum

We have two main **permanent** route updates that are currently in effect.

Due to CyTown constructions at the Iowa State Center commuter lot, [#23 Orange](https://www.cyride.com/Home/Components/News/News/3930/1342?backlist=%2f) has been **permanently** moved to the Northeast side just across from Hilton Coliseum. See the official route map [HERE](https://www.cyride.com/maps/school-year-maps/individual-pdf-maps/23-orange-map).

* *Please note that the above change for #23 Orange was not ultimately CyRide's decision, and any concerns or comments about the change should be directed at Iowa State University.*

There isn't a very large change for #9 Plum, except that the endpoint has changed to go counterclockwise to S.16th/Duff/Buckeye instead of Buckeye/Duff/S.16th. See the official route map [here](https://www.cyride.com/maps/school-year-maps/individual-pdf-maps/9-plum-map) and note the direction of travel at the endpoint. We typically don't have a significant amount of ridership at this location, so impact should be minimal.

The change for #9 Plum is due to a construction project where a concrete median is being installed on South 16th near Buckeye making the left turn not possible.

---

###Detours

Construction season is finally coming to an end, but there are still a few detours in effect that will go into the Fall schedule.

* The largest detour is on #9 Plum, where we are not currently able to provide service east of South Grand and South 16th street. See #9 plum detour information [HERE.](https://www.cyride.com/Home/Components/News/News/3860/1342?backlist=%2f)

* For #6 Brown, #14 Peach and #25 Gold, there are some stop closures on Stange near Schilliter Village due to road construction making the stops unsafe to service. There is a slight detour for #25 Gold, but stops should not be significantly impacted. See detour updates for these routes [HERE.](https://www.cyride.com/Home/Components/News/News/3874/1342?backlist=%2f)

###Electric buses

Our new battery electric buses have arrived! For the bus nerds out there, they are both Nova LFSe+ models with a range of about 260 miles. This was mainly made possible by the [Low or No Emmision Vehicle Program](https://www.transit.dot.gov/lowno) through the FTA and [Volkswagon Clean Air Act Partial Settlements](https://iowadot.gov/VWSettlement/default.aspx) awarded to the State of Iowa. While they *are* more expensive than your average Gillig Low Floor, these grants covered a large majority of the cost of the buses as well as facility improvement for charging stations.

You will see these two buses on #2 Green and #9 Plum route, as they are newer and both of those routes go by the CyRide facility. If they need to be switched out for any reason, this can be achieved easily without impacting service. In the future, we are planning on expanding where they can go, but for now it will be limited to these two routes.

On a personal note, I was actually shocked on the range of these buses; at first I was very skeptical. During testing, we loaded them with about 10,000lbs of sandbags (average of about 20-25 college students) and drove them around for a few hours. in 2.5 hours of driving on a hot summer day with the AC running full-bore, I only managed to knock off about 15% of the battery. They are very comfortable rides and the braking is very smooth, my only concern is how quiet they are on the road, which brings me to my next point: Campus Safety.

---

###Campus and Pedestrian Safety

*(This section represents my own opinion, and is not officially CyRide's opinion or statement.)*

I've been holding off for a while to bring this up in these updates, but I really think it needs to be addressed. Actually, the reason I'm even bringing it up is because one of my trainees told me about a  rumor he heard as a student which terrifies me. He was told by a fellow student that CyRide buses have sensors that will stop the bus automatically if it senses a pedestrian, so he didn't need to worry about walking out in front of a bus. This is **not** true, and if you hear this please correct it. The only thing that is stopping the bus is the driver's foot on the service brake.

Please, please, *please* retain the habit of looking both ways while crossing the street, especially when you're not at a crosswalk, and try to be predictable when you are going to cross. When you de-board the bus, please cross *behind* the bus if possible, especially if it is not on campus. 

Additionally, please read and pay attention to the [crosswalk timer instructions](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fpreviews.123rf.com%2Fimages%2Fjojoo64%2Fjojoo641602%2Fjojoo64160200125%2F51559572-united-states-mutcd-road-sign-crosswalk-instructions.jpg&tbnid=80H3wSE8ieKtXM&vet=12ahUKEwj-laPCwtWAAxWwG94AHYQWCh8QMygDegUIARDWAQ..i&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.123rf.com%2Fphoto_51559572_united-states-mutcd-road-sign-crosswalk-instructions.html&docid=1-vrnLfXMbG7EM&w=782&h=1300&itg=1&q=crosswalk%20timer%20instructions&ved=2ahUKEwj-laPCwtWAAxWwG94AHYQWCh8QMygDegUIARDWAQ) at busy intersections like Lincoln Way and Welch/Lynn/Ash/Beach. The countdown timer at crosswalks is not how much time for pedestrians to start crossing, it is how much time pedestrians have left to finish crossing once started when the walk light appears but before the countdown timer starts. It might not seem like a big deal to start crossing with 10 seconds left, but that blocks traffic trying to turn and can cause unsafe traffic conditions very quickly.

The above said, I'm not going to pretend that CyRide drivers won't also make mistakes while driving. If you witness any unsafe driving behavior, please report it and we can correct it.

*(Again, this section represents my own opinion, and is not an official CyRide's statement.)*

###Moonlight Express

If you don't know what Moonlight Express is, it is a 100% free service that operates on Friday and Saturday nights from 10:30pm-3:00am while classes are in session. You do not need to pay a fare or show your ISU card to use these services.

Moonlight Express is split into two sections - Fixed route and door to door.

* The Moonlight Express ""A"" shuttle still follows a fixed route and runs every 15 minutes. See the A shuttle map [HERE.](https://www.cyride.com/maps/school-year-maps/moonlight-express-service-maps/moonlight-a)

* If you need a ride outside of the service zone on the ""A"" shuttle, we offer an On-Demand service and can generally get a minibus to you within 10-15 minutes, depending on demand for the night. Call the CyRide office OR download the free [Ride Pingo](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ride-pingo/id1536281958) app through iOS or Android and schedule through that.

We are currently talking about re-implementing a ""B"" shuttle that would service Shilliter Village and Freddy Court, but that is not set in stone yet. If that does happen, I will make sure to post a separate update about it later this semester.

###Rider tips and information

For those of you that are new at ISU, it might be scary or overwhelming to start riding or learn the system. It takes a little bit of time, but you'll quickly get the hang of it.

For starters, you'll only need your ISU ID for any route that doesn't start with a ""20."" For #21 Cardinal, #23 Orange (most popular), and #25 Gold, you don't need to show anything to ride. 

When you board, please *always* enter through the front door as the driver has to tally you. We've had an ongoing problem with people boarding through the rear doors, especially on #23 Orange which does not give us accurate counts. After you've boarded, either find a seat or continue moving all the way to the back of the bus if it's a busy trip. The articulated buses can hold about 90 people, and the past few years we've been ""maxing out"" at 70 because riders leave open seats or don't move all the way back. 

When you're ready to deboard, pull the yellow cord or press the stop request buttons throughout the bus. There are some stops which the bus stops at no matter what, but for the majority of stops, the bus will only stop if it is requested. You can exit through any door, front or rear.

If you're new, start by reviewing our [Maps](https://www.cyride.com/maps/summer-maps) and figure out where you live and which routes go by where you're at. The little dots on the map are all bus stops. From there you'll want to look at the [timetables](https://www.cyride.com/schedules/school-year-schedule-3398) to determine what time the bus will depart near you. The SQUARE marks on the map are all timepoints. Note that those timepoints are all ""departure"" times and not arrival times, so I would give yourself an extra minute or two to ensure you don't miss the bus. 

MyState has great resources for bus predictions, but it isn't perfect. My suggestion would be to use the printed timetable to *plan* your trips and know approximately what time the bus will depart, and use MyState to determine where the bus is at in real time. 

The buses all have printed schedules when you board - I would grab one and read the rider information to learn about it. 

If you have any questions such as needing to plan a trip or transfer information, feel free to give CyRide a call. We generally pick up with 2-3 rings and you don't have to sit through an automated system. Additionally, feel free to message me or leave a comment in this thread.

Now they just forced everyone to either get in before 10:30 and wait until close to 11 for food to be put out or sit through an even worse lunch rush with a line that builds up for a half hour.

There's ups and downs to any decision, though. I thought maybe the food would be better if they weren't doing service and could focus on it, but it turns out that the chicken lo mein they cooked and then put in a plastic container and set on a cold counter for ten minutes before putting out wasn't brimming with hot freshness.

1532,Comment,"Short answer: yes, but.

The ""but"" is that we have jurisdictional limits on what we can do with the Greek organizations.  Their houses are not ISU buildings, nor on ISU land, so we have limited direct oversight and enforcement.  For example, because their housing contracts aren't with us, we can't automagically move them from normal room assignments to isolation/quarantine the way we can with students who have ISU residential contracts.  

(Edit: That does not, of course, apply to the Greek members who *are* living in the res halls.  The above is specific to the fraternity/sorority houses.)

Having said that - the Dean of Students Office has a Greek Affairs unit that liaises with all of the Greek orgs.  They've been working with both the local chapters and the national organizations all summer to provide guidance, help them develop plans, and ensure they're tied in on the Cyclones Care campaign and aligned with our residential policies.  The national-level organizations are more concerned about this than the behavior of members on a local level may suggest.",1,9,,i1de58,t1_fzzi0n0,/r/iastate/comments/i1de58/i_just_completed_move_in_and_covid_testing/fzzj6yh/

1548,Post,"On March 17, 1869, 173 students -- 136 men and 37 women -- began classes at the Iowa Agricultural College and Model Farm, the first official day of classes for the school. The students, some of the smartest in the state, came from 55 Iowa counties.

In his address at the opening ceremony, Benjamin Gue, president of the Board of Trustees and former lieutenant governor of Iowa, stated:

>""Who of us can foresee the future of this Institution, which we this day dedicate to the education of the working people of Iowa?  It needs no prophet to foretell that its influence upon the youth of these classes, must in no very distant future be felt far and wide.  We may not live to see this day, but the time will surely come in which graduates of the Iowa Agricultural College will be found among the most eminent men and women that our State or this country can produce.... inculcating correct principles, pure morals, free from prejudice, bigotry and false pride, they cannot fail to attain the highest positions of honor and trust.... and by their lives honor the institution to whose fostering care they are so indebted.""

Read his [full address and those from others here](http://cdm16001.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/fullbrowser/collection/p16001coll3/id/1839/rv/compoundobject/cpd/1887). Gue was a former state legislature and in an 1858 speech persuaded his fellow legislators to vote in favor of the college when its defeat has previously seemed imminent. Read his not-too-long account of [ISU's origins here](http://cdm16001.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15031coll22/id/1139/rec/5).

Here is the [Main Building](http://historicexhibits.lib.iastate.edu/buildings/oldmain.html), which is 1869 was *the* building on campus. There were a couple animal barns, Farm House (which I [highly recommend walking through](https://www.museums.iastate.edu/visit/farm-house-museum) before you leave ISU), and a residence for the President Welch, but the Main housed all the students, faculty, and staff. Men lived in the upper two floors (3rd and 4th), women lived on the 2nd floor. Classrooms, chapel, library, and offices were on the first floor. The bottom floor included the much loathed dining hall, which in the decades to come, became the most famous thing on campus. Several buildings were built in the next few decades, but life revolved around the Main for the university's first 30 years. It stood roughly where Beardshear Hall does today.

So you weren't at the stop on time and you're mad because the *free* public bus that runs every 16 to 25 minutes left instead of making everyone else who came on time wait for you to cross the street and walk to the stop. 

I would say this driver deserves accommodation for their outstanding service. 

Walking in the direction of a bus stop doesnt tell the driver you want on board. People walk on sidewalks all the time. And most transit systems dont allow drivers to pick up in places that aren't designated stops, especially stop signs, because it's a liability.

Then you can give an even more tailored, shorter elevator pitch without all the fluff and only the relevant portions. I think this slight modification can be really effective.

1598,Post,"Hi there! I am desperately looking for someone to take over the rest of my lease at my current apartment because I need to move back home to help take care of my mom!

The lease ends at the end of July.It's located in a really good part of Ames and is only 5 minutes from campus. It offers a quiet space on the top floor with 1 bed, 1 bath, a full kitchen, a living room, 4 closets, an office, and a balcony! Parking is free but you can rent a garage for an additional fee.

This place is pet friendly! Monthly, rent is $936, internet is $50, utilities which includes gas is $50, and risk mitigation is $15.The nice thing about this place is that you are able to pay part of rent at the start of the month and the rest at another time in the month.

Currently packing but here's a little snippet of what the living room looks like with the office off to the side of it.

Will include my microwave and also my \~$120 sliding door insert doggy door (in the photo) and some plants if you take on my lease.

Let me know if you're interested!

>This can obviously be altered, but it's a way better start than you reading your memorized boring elevator speech. 

Strongly disagree. This makes you come across like you have done zero research and just came to stop by through a happenchance. Also, you should definitely have questions but starting off by literally asking for ""any information"" shows you have done zero research.

You shouldn't be giving the same speech to each company. There's basic information that you should relay which is pretty similar no matter which company you're talking to, but your speech should also include why you're interested in their company. Students line up by the hundreds simply because they want an internship. 

Why did you want to talk to *this* company? What do you have that makes you good enough that they should interview you? 

Give them the basic info, tell them what qualifies you for this specific company and position, and refer to why you have such a strong interest in their company.

This is an easy way to blow them off their feet right away. You're not left hoping the conversation leads down the right alley. I've heard a lot of students use your method and often times the recruiter immediately goes into basic questions about you and your resume which you should've already used to get them interested.


> you do not need a suit and tie for a career fair.

Also, this is a bit off too. For the engineering career fair, it's strongly recommended and I'd say around 95% of male students wear full suits.

Let's get to it.

**Public Health Measures for Campus**

*Face coverings* are encouraged but not required for most areas.  They're required in specific spaces, including:

* public transportation (CyRide; Transportation Security Administration requirement)

* Ames Laboratory facilities (U.S. Department of Energy requirement)

* healthcare settings, including Thielen Student Health Center

* areas of the College of Veterinary Medicine where they're normally required

* research laboratories, as determined by principal investigator or lab supervisor

*Vaccination* is encouraged but not required.

**Background** 

* [Policy direction from Iowa Board of Regents](https://www.iowaregents.edu/news/board-news/statement-from-president-mike-richards-lifting-regents-state-of-emergency), issued May 20, 2021

* [Iowa House File 889](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ba=HF%20889&ga=89), enacted May 20, 2021.

* [ISU senior leadership memo to campus](https://www.president.iastate.edu/communications/messages/2021/8/10-fall21), issued August 10, 2021

* [ISU Provost's memo to faculty](https://www.provost.iastate.edu/policies/provost-s-office-communications/ay2021-22-svpp-communication--1--fall-syllabus-statements-and-faq), issued August 10, 2021

**Public Health Status**

It ain't where we were last November, but it's a long way from being good.

Statewide, we are seeing an ongoing surge, almost exclusively the Delta strain.  Hospitals are low on space due to a combination of factors - new COVID cases, a backlog of elective or non-emergent procedures that they were trying to clear over the summer, and other seasonal illnesses.  This combines with a dwindling healthcare workforce (many people have decided to seek other professions because of fatigue and frustration) and a remaining workforce that is exhausted.

Locally, Mary Greeley Medical Center's numbers of admitted COVID patients have been up for the past month.  **In the past 7 days, 75% of new COVID cases in Story County have been from the 18-29 age range and 100% have been the Delta strain**.

*****

**Testing Status**

Currently, we do not have a mass testing site operating on campus.  If you're a student and symptomatic, you can schedule a test through Thielen Student Health Center - [go to their site](https://health.iastate.edu/) and hit the Appointments link at the bottom right corner of the page.

Iowa closed its TestIowa sites over the summer due to low positivity rates and low utilization.  The state's preferred testing methods today are to see your normal healthcare provider or to [pick up a home test kit](https://www.testiowa.com/en/) ([FAQ here](https://health.iastate.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FAQ-Public-Test-Iowa-Pick-Up-Site-7.16.21.pdf) - hooray, self-service saliva science).  Thielen Student Health Center is a pick-up location.  We also have satellite pick-up locations at Union Drive Community Center and the Memorial Union, though those aren't listed on the TestIowa site.

*****

**Vaccine Status**

Last Friday, August 13, the FDA and CDC issued final approval for immunocompromised individuals to receive COVID booster shots (third dose) of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine formulations, eight months after their second shots.  Immunocompromised people make up roughly 3% of the U.S. adult population - but account for 44% of hospitalized breakthrough infections (i.e., infections in vaccinated persons).

About an hour ago, the FDA and CDC [released a statement](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/08/18/joint-statement-hhs-public-health-and-medical-experts-covid-19-booster-shots.html) that third-dose boosters of Pfizer and Moderna will be recommended for the general population starting September 20.  As with the limited approval for immunocompromised individuals, the general population approval is for eight months after second dose, so healthcare personnel will be the first to receive third doses.  We'd been seeing the same news reports as all of you but the official green light is very new, so at this time I can't say anything more about how we'll handle that on campus.

At this time, there's no official statement on a booster dose for people who received the J&J vaccine.  Stay tuned for more news.

On campus, we continue to offer vaccination clinics with Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson formulations.  [See my previous post for the current schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/ozcliq/fall_21_covid_vaccination_clinics_more_dates/).

*****

**Perspective, and What You Can Do to Help**

Unpopular opinion up front: everything I'm hearing from public health colleagues who study epidemiology indicates that we are unlikely to ever eradicate COVID-19 completely.  A more realistic goal is reducing its transmissibility to a point that normal public health controls can manage individual cases or local outbreaks before they generate mass hospitalizations or deaths.

That hinges on vaccination.

All of our previous public health measures - face coverings, online classes, canceled football games, social distancing, salad bar sneeze guards in front of podiums - all of those efforts were to buy us time for vaccine development and deployment.  Remember all of the ""flatten the curve"" graphics from spring of '20?  We made that happen.  We weren't stacking bodies on Mary Greeley's loading dock and we didn't have to turn Lied Rec into a field hospital - not because COVID wasn't so bad, but because enough people complied with the protective measures that we did hold back the tide.

For the last year and a half, we as a country have done a crappy job of managing the mental health aspect of this disaster.  America's mental health apparatus was a traveshamockery before COVID.  Now I fear we're going straight from a COVID pandemic into a mental health epidemic, [especially for you and other students across the country](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/08/17/suicidal-ideation-rise-college-aged-adults-due-covid-19-pandemic).  In studies of disaster survivors' mental health, we see that they have better short- and long-term outcomes if they're given agency and a list of productive actions to take.  ""Stay home and stay away from people"" was pretty much the geometic opposite of that.

**Getting vaccinated is the number one thing you can do to protect yourself and others**.  If there was ever a case of ""it's not about you,"" this is it.  No, vaccination is not a 100% guarantor of never getting COVID - but that shouldn't be news because *no* vaccine is 100% effective.  However, it:

* reduces your chance of catching COVID;

* reduces your chance of severe symptoms if you do catch COVID; 

* reduces your chance of transmitting infection to others; and

* reduces the likelihood that high transmission rates will generate a mutation that's worse than Delta.

The other part of this is to change the conversation around vaccination so it becomes a social norm.  ISU can't require you to disclose your vaccination status (see the link above to HF 889 for the reason why).  The current interpretation of that is that as ISU employees, my colleagues and I can't even ask the question.  *But you can.*  You can ask your friends and classmates and partners about their vaccination status (and, without making this a conversation about sex and dating, vaccination status might be one of several things you might want to know about a potential hookup...).  You can help make vaccination something that is expected - ""when did you get vaccinated?"" rather than ""are you vaccinated?""

The tricky part - and my hypocrisy knows no bounds here, because my frustration often exceeds my patience and compassion these days - is making it a non-judgemental, non-accusatory conversation.  Public shaming can feel satisfying in the short term but it rarely brings about the behavioral change we desire, and if it does, that change comes with undesired baggage.  If someone has concerns about side-effects or needle anxiety, you can help them through that (or /u/CycloneHealth can).  If someone has bad information about vaccination, you can provide them more current and accurate data points.  This, by the way, is also a part of the mental health issue I mentioned above - for both you and them.  Let's stop marinating our brains in cortisol.

There are other things you can do, too.  Face coverings are currently recommended indoors, even for fully-vaccinated people, and I'm pretty sure many of you stuffed them in your underwear drawers rather than throwing them away.  Now is the time to consider pulling them back out (and washing them - ew) and bringing them to class with you again.  Weigh the real value of the 801 Day Superspreader Sausagefest - you can get just as drunk at a smaller gathering where you can actually hear the conversations.  And don't lick door handles or other people's stuff.

*****

As always, I'm being as open as I can, but there's stuff going on behind the scenes that I can't talk about - unannounced decisions, confidential healthcare information, plans we've committed to executing but are still working on implementing.  Please remember that a lot of really smart people are working on this thing every day.  It may be happening out of sight but it is happening.

Thanks for reading.  Please hug (consensually) a custodian or a Student Health employee the next time you see them.

1716,Comment,"as someone who goes to isu and also looks ""different"" (ie. black hair and facial piercings) who spent the first two years of undergrad feeling the same way that you do, the best and most honest advice i can give you is this:

you need to approach people first, because they likely won't approach you.

whenever i ask my friends and classmates what about mw was so off-putting, the answer was always the same. ""you just seemed intimidating at first."" a lot of people that go to isu may not have actual experience with individuals with ""alternative"" lifestyles (whether that be fashion or identity) but after you open up a conversation and show them that you, too, are just a... normal person, they typically open up pretty quickly.

and while starting a conversation with a stranger may sound daunting, it really doesn't have to be. yesterday i turned to the girl next to me (who was a stranger in my eyes, and had pretty closed off body language initially) and commented on how ridiculously small the room we were in was, she immediately latched onto the conversation and did a 180. come to find out not have we both attended the same school for years, but we also both work for the same off-campus job. 

so, start conversations. connect over your class or major, or professors. look at people's laptop stickers and bag pins to find people with shared interests or communities, and start a convo abt that. there are definitely bigots on campus but chances are no one is gonna be malicious towards you for starting a convo about something you have in common.

1756,Post,"So over the past six months or so my father and I have been discussing capitalism(C), socialism(S), and communism(Co).  He very much believes in capitalism thinking that socialism and communism are very bad forms of government.  Looked like I hit him with Abrams tank when I proposed that capitalism, socialism, and communism are all economic models with the later two not actually being governing models.

So let me lay out an argument here.  All three economic models can survive in a democracy or republic form of government.  I will also later talk about how I see each one fitting best with a particular form of government.

So lets lay out a basic understanding of the three models:
C: Individual citizens (of some society) control the means of production and reap the rewards of the company.
S: The workers of a society control the means of production and reap the rewards of their company.
Co: The government controls the means of production and reaps the rewards of the companies.
(Note that society in this is a very ambiguous term and can be anything from local communities to the global community.)

So being economic models and not governance models C, S, and Co can all exist in our current for of democratic republic.  C strives to stimulate economic growth through the law of supply and demand.  That is the more workers there are the lower the demand for a worker is thus the lower the wage is and conversely the fewer workers there are the higher the wages should be (I won't get into the semantics of is this actually what is happening).  This is true for the products that are being sold also.  High supply and low demand means low prices while low supply and high demand means high prices.  There is nothing innate to C that makes it unable to function in a democracy or republic.

S is an interesting case because in practice I don't believe we have ever actually seen this economic model implemented.  We tend to see either C or Co.  How ever in practice this economic model actually would function more closely to a democracy than any other model in the fact that it requires the input of all workers when decisions need made.  Now this isn't to say that you need an unanimous agreement among workers to implement a new work place policies or that one worker can shut down the system.  There are still social rules that must be followed.  They just may be different than the ones we follow today.

Co is the other major economic model have seen emerge in the world.  Where the government controls the production and reaps the rewards.  Again this isn't innately a bad system.  The problem that we have seen is this system only really has been used under autocratic or fascist regimes so we tend to fear it.  If we as a people set up rules for how a government using this model is to conduct itself and what it is to do with the spoils of the companies it controls there is no reason that this form of economy could not function in a democracy or republic.

So a quick run down of what type of government I think each would flourish under and you are free to agree or disagree this is purely opinion and speculation.
C: This doesn't really flourish under any sort of government.  It relies solely on supply and demand as its driving force.  Any sort of government would only function to regulate this mechanic and in doing so move the economic model more towards one of the other two economic models
S: This would be the ultimate exercise in democracy.  While democracy is too slow to work in large scale societies each company actually functions as a much smaller society so issues still could be resolved in a timely manner.
Co: This would work best in a republic.  As I have already said on the scale of which Co works democracy isn't a functional option.  You would have to shrink down the number of decisions makers and the best way to do that is for people to elect other people who they think will best represent their interests in that process.

There's a few hundred other students living in Wilson who are also going to be learning bus schedules, where to eat, etc., so you won't be alone if you do choose to live there.

1769,Post,"Hey, team.  There are a lot of questions around ISU's mass vaccination effort (as of today, April 13), so the mods have graciously offered me a temporary sticky for centralizing responses.

Please understand that there are some questions I can't answer.  As has been the case since last February, the situation is evolving constantly, and I don't have all the information personally.  There may also be issues I can't address because they touch on things on which ISU is still working, and I can't preannounce policy decisions that aren't final.  Finally, I'm going to be on site at our mass vax clinics every day, so my time to check in here may be limited on those days (and I'm going to bed as soon as I post this, so no more responses tonight...).

Having given you the caveats, I'll break down our current plans and intentions to the best of my ability.  You can consider this an update of [my previous vaccination update from March 9](https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/m0pv9f/dispatches_from_the_eoc_march_vaccine_update/).  As always, I am not an ISU spokesperson, and you should refer to [ISU's main vaccine FAQ page](https://web.iastate.edu/safety/updates/covid19/vaccinations) for the latest official statements.

*****

**Vaccine Availability**

As of this writing, the FDA has issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for three COVID-19 vaccine formulas.  Pfizer's vaccine requires two doses with a three-week wait between the first (""prime"") and second (""boost"") doses.  Moderna's vaccine is a two-dose regimen with a four-week wait.  Johnson & Johnson (or Janssen - Janssen Biotech is a division of big J&J) is a single-dose formula.

On the morning of April 13, the FDA and CDC jointly issued [an advisory about the Johnson & Johnson vaccine](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/joint-cdc-and-fda-statement-johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine).  This is due to six reported cases of a rare and potentially severe type of blood clot that formed in female patients, age 18 to 48, between 6 and 13 days after receiving the J&J vaccine.  Similar issues have been reported in patients who received the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is not currently approved for U.S. deployment and which is broadly similar to the J&J vaccine (don't ask me for details, not a biochemist).  The Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) issued its own advisory later that same day, and Story County Public Health (SCPH) and ISU are complying with that.

More on the impacts of that below.

*****

**How Vaccine Gets to ISU**

This is pretty much unchanged from my March post, but I'll repeat it here to pad my word count.  Ask your instructors for guidance on citing your own prior work in proper APA format!

In the United States, the CDC centrally controls COVID-19 vaccine distribution. The companies handling distribution and production ship vaccine to state, territorial, and tribal public health agencies according to CDC guidance. Here, IDPH receives Iowa's shipments.  It then distributes each of those shipments among all 99 of Iowa's counties, as well as to pharmacies in the state that are authorized to dispense vaccine. At the county level, the local public health agency receives the county allocation. Depending on county-level capabilities, it then administers the vaccine itself or hands it off to local partners to administer.

Here in Story County, our local public health agency is SCPH. When SCPH gets a vaccine drop from the state, they administer some of it themselves in smaller-scale clinics, usually targeting specific populations who it's easy to corral in one place.  The rest is divided among school districts, long-term care facilities (i.e., nursing homes), hospitals (Mary Greeley Medical Center and Story County Medical Center, healthcare clinics (e.g., McFarland), and ISU.

Note that the supply chain is still not consistent, especially with regards to the Johnson & Johnson formula.  That means for any given week, we don't know how many doses of vaccine we're going to get until the prior week.  As I write this (the night of April 13), we'll likely find out tomorrow how many doses we're going to receive for our mass vax clinics that are scheduled for April 19-23.

(The pharmacy supply chain runs in parallel to all of this through [the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/retail-pharmacy-program/index.html).  You can read more about it at that link because I don't know enough about it to write intelligently.)

*****

**Appointment Ghosting and the Two-Dose Logistics Problem**

I've alluded to this in other recent responses but I want to raise its visibility here.  Each vaccination provider is allocated an equal number of prime and boost doses.  The whole system assumes that each patient will get their prime and boost dose in the same place.  Trying to go different places for prime and boost doses breaks this system.  The original provider - say, ISU - suddenly has an unclaimed boost dose that they have to figure out what to do with.  Meanwhile, the patient rolls up to a different provider - say, the West Possum Trot General Store and Pharmacy - who has no idea that patient is coming and doesn't have a boost dose prepped for them.

Dose math is further complicated by the fact that all three vaccines ship in multi-dose vials.  Once a vial is punctured, it's only good for a limited number of hours before any unused doses must be discarded.  For the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, they're also only good for a limited number of hours once removed from really frickin' cold (technical term, ask a biochemist) storage.  So if we schedule 100 doses of vaccine, we pull 100 doses out of the ice cream freezer.  If someone doesn't show up for their appointment, we have to toss that dose or run around and find some rando to vaccinate.  We don't like wasting doses.  We also don't like looking like shady street pharmacists (""hey, kid, you want a lollipop and a vaccine?"").

*****

**Vaccine Prioritization**

My March 9 post explained the prioritization system in place at the time.  Subsequently, Governor Reynolds opened up vaccine eligibilty to everyone in Iowa with an effective date of April 5.

This means everyone (age 16 and up; nothing is yet approved for younger patients) is *allowed* to get vaccinated.  It doesn't mean there's enough vaccine in the state to vaccinate everyone.

Also, on March 31, Governor Reynolds announced that she was prioritizing vaccine deliveries to Iowa colleges and universities with the intent of vaccinating as many students as possible before the end of the academic year.  She specifically mentioned the J&J formulation because of its single-dose simplicity, and because of the complications involved in scheduling a second dose that might fall after the end of the academic year.  There's some schedule flexibility for off-campus residents whose leases may run 'til August and who might stay in Ames after finals week, but very little flexibility for campus residents who have a fixed and rapidly-approaching move-out date.

As those who are regulars on this sub have seen, deploying J&J to all of you is... complicated right now.  The doses we already have in inventory, which were scheduled for Thursday (April 15), may well be okay to administer.  But we're going to hold off on doing that until the FDA and CDC complete their investigation and IDPH gives us the go-ahead to resume dispensing it.

In the meantime, those of you who can read a calendar and do simple math have looked at the timeline above and gone, ""hmm... three weeks means that anyone who gets a Pfizer prime dose after Friday the 16th will be scheduled for their boost dose after the semester ends.""  Fortunately, we have a couple of things we can do.

**The Immediate Fix**

I often use ""drug deal"" as a tongue-in-cheek metaphor for acquiring resources expediently, so it amuses me that today, ISU did that literally.  Our local healthcare partners handed us a thousand prime doses of Pfizer, so everyone who was originally scheduled for J&J on this Thursday is instead going to receive a Pfizer prime, with a Pfizer boost appointment date of May 6.

**Looking Ahead to the Next Three Weeks**

I don't like saying this because I like being able to give you definite answers, but the next weeks involve a lot of uncertainty (as is typical for the 16th month of 2020).  I mentioned above that we don't receive notice of a week's vaccine delivery numbers until the prior week, so I don't know tonight how many doses of vaccine we'll get for the operations currently scheduled to run the 20th through 23rd.

Also, because of today's CDC/FDA/IDPH guidance, I don't know if any of what we get will be J&J, or when we'll get more than we already had in inventory for this Thursday.  If the CDC/FDA/IDPH clear us to administer J&J, we can deliver the doses we already have.  We'll also be able to administer any more that the state might give us.

Regardless, shipments of Pfizer and Moderna are continuing.  Again, I don't know numbers, but if we can get those, we can administer them.  This does raise the issue of prime/boost dose mismatches (see above).  *My opinion only, not a policy statement:* the most effective deployment for those would be to students who will be in Ames through mid-to-late May to get their boost doses here, and those whose hometowns are close enough to Ames that they'll be able to drive back here for their second appointments.  *Again, that's just me looking at it from a non-medical, non-policy-maker perspective, and it may work out vastly differently.*

**Added 4/14: Non-ISU Sources of Vaccine**

/u/Turbulent-Parfait-32 has assembled [an excellent guide to local sources of vaccine other than ISU](https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/mqum5q/vaccine_options/).  If you're looking for other options, check out their post (and don't forget to updoot for all their hard work)!

*****

**What To Expect at State Gym**

Bring your ISUCard (red card).  We can work with you if you don't have it, but registration will flow faster with it.

Show up on time for your appointment.  We spread out the appointment times to ensure we'd have a smooth and steady patient flow.  If you roll in early, we may not have a dose prepped for you yet.  *If you're more than 15 minutes late, we'll assume you're a no-show and will be looking for someone else to receive the dose that was yours.*

Come to the south side of State Gym, off parking lot 1.  There will be signs on the sidewalk directing you up a concrete ramp to a door that is normally a fire exit.  It'll be open for you.  Come on in.

As you enter, you'll see someone in a blue vest with reflective trim.  Blue vests are *wayfinders* and *medical observers*.  They're there to help you navigate through the process and answer basic questions about it.  (If you need help with an issue they aren't prepped to address, look for someone in a green or red vest - those are supervisors and command staff.)

Someone in a blue vest will give you a sticker with a letter on it - ""A"" through ""H.""  This indicates which cluster of registration and vaccination stations you'll use.  We have 36 registration desks and 24 vaccination stations, so we needed a way to spread the workload evenly - this is what we settled on.

When you get to your registration station, you'll swipe your ISUCard at a card reader to start the medical records process.  We'll ask you to fill out a vaccination consent form.  If you have any problems with the registration process, we'll move you to a different desk where TSHC medical staff will help you.

Once you're through registration, our wayfinders will direct you to your vaccination station.  This is where you'll actually get jabbed (it's a very small needle).  If you have needle anxiety or need privacy for other reasons, please ask - we have three vaccination stations curtained off for this very thing.

After receiving your vaccination, you'll get your vaccination record card and a reminder card for the date and time of your boost dose.  The reminder card will also have contact info for rescheduling if you have a conflict (e.g., final exam).  A wayfinder will direct you to our waiting area, where we'll ask you to hang out for 15 minutes.  If you begin to develop any symptoms of a severe reaction, one of our observers will get you to a medical provider who'll take care of you.  We haven't had any severe reactions at ISU yet, but this is a standard precaution.

After your wait time is up, you're free to go!

*****

**What About Vaccination Selfies?**

Yes!  We'll have an area designated for this.  For patient privacy, please take photos *only* in the designated area.  Don't get anyone else in your selfie without their consent.

(Also, don't put your vaccination card in your selfie unless you're sure you want all of the information on it online.)

*****

**Last Thoughts**

Putting this whole operation together has been a massive effort and all of the uncertainties of the timeline and vaccine availability have been an emotional roller-coaster.  The future is still ambiguous.  But we've spent the last 14 months telling you *not* to do things.  Don't gather in groups.  Don't take off your mask.  Don't come to class.  Don't come to campus.  Don't stand too close together.  Don't have any fun whatsoever.  We haven't given you a whole lot of affirmative, constructive actions to take, which is a pretty awful position in which to put disaster survivors.

Now we get to change that.  Getting vaccinated is that affirmative, constructive action.  This is something you *can* do to help us all get out of this hellscape.

\    With each plan ranging from 100 to 600 dollars per year. You are forced to spend each penny by the end of the year or you will lose this balance at the end of each academic year. Currently, students are able to obtain DD and/or Cycash (CC) Though CC is voluntary, they do not expire after each academic year. They only expire if your account has not activity for a full calendar year. In addition, CC can be used at any location on campus just like DD. Both DD & CC are re-loadable.

In all, since CyCash is more friendlier to students, just as versatile on campus, and do not expire like DD do. Dining dollars should be abolished and should be switched over to CyCash.\

1780,Comment,"West Village Apartments are really nice. I live in a one bedroom apartment and I have an in unit washer and dryer, plus they aren't too far from campus. The lilac route and cherry route of the cyride have nearby stops or the commuter lot for the orange route is like a 5 minute drive. Also the leasing company is pretty great, I have a cat and there was no pet deposit and no monthly pet rent. I just had to let them know I have a cat and give a short description, plus they don't require rental history or proof of income. You basically just sign the lease which is a single paper. I've had to make several maintenance requests and they always show up the day after the request is made. One of the requests I had to put in was that my dishwasher was leaking and they ended up putting a brand new dishwasher in, most other apartments just take dishwashers out instead of replacing them. Overall ive lived in 3 different apartments before this one and this is by far the best leasing company I've ever been with, they're super friendly, efficient, and easy to work with. Plus each unit has a balcony and the units themselves are really nice. And they're dog friendly too, so they allow more than just cats. Also they don't require you to have your unit shown for new renters but if you do want your unit to be a show unit they'll add a credit to your account for each showing, so basically you'll get a small discount on rent if you don't mind your apartment being shown to people. There's also a Kum and Go right across the street within walking distance along with a cafe, a gym, a liquor store, and various other shops. Overall it's a super lax leasing company and I highly recommend the west village apartments.",2,2,,q9iv2w,t3_q9iv2w,/r/iastate/comments/q9iv2w/recommendations_for_a_studio1_bed_1_bath_apartment/hgxufno/

I guess that the campus empties out and it is pretty lonely and bleak during the winter break. For folks who do stay back, how do you get to dining halls in the snow, if at all they stay open. If not, do we just have to grab a bite at Convos? where else can we get a bite on campus? Do we just use our dining dollars?

Also, what do you do to stay sane when the campus empties out? Not that the campus is hopping currently.

Meal swipes also use a full ‚Äúswipe‚Äù even if you don‚Äôt use the full value of what a swipe costs (if you only grab $10 of food but the swipe cost $12, you just lost $2)

The only time meal swipes are worth is if you are going to be going to dining centers. Those are pricy to use dining dollars on (like $13 I believe). 

However, as a freshman and living in a dorm, cooking is almost impossible. I think you‚Äôll find that you want to go to dining centers quite often.

Oh wait, those are all things that should make the business model easier to work with. I don't quite get how meal plans are as expensive as they are.

If you were running for the stop, or were there at 59 seconds after the top of the scheduled minute, either figure out how to be at the stop ahead of the scheduled time or plan to take a later bus. It should be noted that the scheduled time is the time per the NIST atomic clock, not whatever random time source you may be looking at. Granted, this is less of an issue now than it was before everybody was carrying GPS-linked clocks in their pockets, but it still stands. 

Every bus has interior _and_ exterior cameras, and the supervisors absolutely do review complaints and consult the video if needed, especially if there‚Äôs a safety concern. I drove before all the shiny new technology, but I suspect they also keep historical GPS records and can refer to those if there is a pattern of complaints. 

In my experience as both a dispatcher and a driver, the majority of ‚Äúthe bus left early!‚Äù or ‚Äúthey left me at the stop‚Äù were really people running late trying to catch a bus running on time.

1944,Post,"**Please stop reporting the bird that's north of Hoover**

Hey fellow students,

I'm an Animal Ecology student and I'm designing a study centered around bird deaths as a result of window-collisions on our main campus.

If anyone finds a bird carcass on main campus, I would super appreciate it if you could reply to this chain or PM me with an approximate location of the bird (e.g. south side of Gilman Hall, right side of the main entrance). This will help me design my project, and I'll be submitting data to the National Audubon Society as well.

Thanks everyone!

Edit: Thanks for all your help so far! I'm electing to not collect data on the bird north of Hoover, since it's very badly damaged. However, I did get data on the two birds by Durham (one of them was decapitated - I moved that one out of site). The likeliness of me finding any birds that were spotted more than a week ago are pretty slim due to predators and custodians.

This is a follow-up to [the thread I started Wednesday](https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/j2py5k/how_could_we_make_spring_semester_less_awful/) in which I solicited your suggestions for ways to make the spring semester less awful.  I'd like to thank everyone who provided input.  I, and my anonymous colleagues who've also read the thread, appreciate your thoughtfulness.  Over the next week, I'll be doing what I can to get many of those suggestions in front of the appropriate parties.

In that thread, /u/dancer_jasmine1, /u/Hornetpride, and /u/t_britten pointed out a couple of instructors who are putting in extra work to make online or hybrid class deliveries run as smoothly and painlessly as possible.  I had planned to follow up on that, and I was in a discussion yesterday on ways to identify and disseminate best practices in instruction under the shadow of COVID.  That conversation added some urgency to my interest, so:

Again, I am listening.  While keeping in mind my usual disclaimers - this is not official, I'm not a VP, and I promise nothing beyond an ear - what are some things your instructors are doing this semester that are making your learning experience easier or reducing your overall stress level?  How can other instructors learn from them to make the spring semester better?

For what it‚Äôs worth, the brakes are pretty much binary in the buses - they‚Äôre either off or on, and are somewhat fickle between every bus. They‚Äôre air brakes, not hydraulic, so stops aren‚Äôt always going to be glass smooth like it would be in your car. Additionally, what the drivers feel in their seat is not identical to what the passengers feel, so sometimes they have no idea that their ride might be a little rough and likely aren‚Äôt trying to make for an intentionally rough ride. That being said, it should still be a comfortable ride as long as you‚Äôre seated or holding onto the stanchions, and drivers shouldn‚Äôt be accelerating hard only to have to brake hard immediately after.

If you feel like you‚Äôve had a rough ride or unsafe ride, please note the bus number (3 or 4 digit number on the inside and outside of the bus), the time you were riding, and the route you were riding. You can call or email CyRide to let them know. Your information is confidential and won‚Äôt be shared with the drivers.

\    With each plan ranging from 100 to 600 dollars per year. You are forced to spend each penny by the end of the year or you will lose this balance at the end of each academic year. Currently, students are able to obtain DD and/or Cycash (CC) Though CC is voluntary, they do not expire after each academic year. They only expire if your account has not activity for a full calendar year. In addition, CC can be used at any location on campus just like DD. Both DD & CC are re-loadable.

In all, since CyCash is more friendlier to students, just as versatile on campus, and do not expire like DD do. Dining dollars should be abolished and should be switched over to CyCash.\

2114,Post,"This one's been on my mind for a while.  Less operations today; more reflection.
 
Every culture has its own folklore.  Emergency services are no exception.  Among the closely-held beliefs of those who work the streets and the emergency rooms is the forbidden word.  It's five letters long.  It starts with ""Q.""  If you use it, the condition it describes will cease.
 
I've seen it happen.  The first time was years ago, on a third-shift ride-along with Lexington-Fayette PD.  An officer who really should have known better said the ""Q"" word in roll call.  That shift saw *nine* Signal 7 (officer needs assistance) calls.  I learned what it was like to do 85mph down UK's equivalent of Osborne.  Shortly thereafter, I learned that pepper spray isn't entirely directional.
 
Last fall, someone said it in the emergency operations center a few hours before kickoff of the ISU-UofI game.  We all know how *that* day went.
 
So it is with some trepidation that I consider using the ""Q"" word to describe campus these days.
 
Campus isn't closed, exactly.  It isn't shut down.  But it can feel that way.  Less so, now that the weather is softening and the days are sliding toward the solstice.  But still... in the mornings, I cross Sheldon where West becomes Union, and it's deserted except for CyRide (thank you, drivers and dispatchers, for standing your posts through this).  The morning sun is shining through an empty skywalk between State Gym and Beyer.  I can get across campus to the EOC without seeing another person.

From the EOC, it's easy to lose sight of this.  We're on the edge of campus with no windows.  As we've moved from urgent decision-making and action to sustained coordination and planning, our work has developed a rhythm of its own.  Executive call at 0800, release the day's incident action plan by 0845, workgroup leader calls at 0900 and 1530, get the day's SITREP to the executives by 1700, other coordination and status updates in between all of that.  The status reports and data dumps make it easy to abstract what's happening - and what isn't.
 
But when I can, I get out of the EOC at lunch to walk and see sunlight, and the sidewalks are empty.  A couple of weeks ago, I stood in the middle of Osborne at Lagomarcino just because I could - it was completely devoid of traffic.  There is a slightly unreal quality to the emptiness (and the inaccessibility of the buildings), as if I'm in a glitched level of a game where the scenery has loaded but the NPCs haven't.
 
And yet... campus *isn't* empty.  We still have about 300 students in the residence halls and another 2,500 or so in the apartments.  Close to a thousand employees are still working on campus, doing the critical hands-on work that can't be done remotely.  We could draw that down further if we absolutely had to, if Governor Reynolds issued a more stringent stay-at-home order, but doing so would have its own consequences.  Right now, we're where we need to be for the current public health imperatives.
 
On a day like this, our normal daytime population would be over 40,000.
 
Campus is... the word I cannot say, even here... and it shouldn't be.  The silence is unnatural.  This *isn't right*.

In time, we'll figure out what normal looks like after COVID-19.  But this is the part where we do all the work to get there, and it kinda sucks.",6,31,0.93,g6xgbq,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/g6xgbq/dispatches_from_the_eoc_the_q_word/

Dining Dollars - Money that can be spent at most places on campus for food items. Ramen, snacks, gatorade, stuff that you would get a walgreens. Also panda express and subway.

CyCash - Money that can be spent for anything. Laundry mostly, but books or food items can also be bought with CyCash.

You can also buy books and such and charge to your UBill, which is what you pay your tuition, housing etc on.
____
You can get to just about anywhere via bike. I longboard and have no problem. The bus system is pretty great too, if you live off campus you'll probably use it on terrible weather days.

If multiple teachers are teaching the same class, it's fairly likely you could just attend whichever lecture you want, and just attend exams with your professor. Do you have an advisor yet?

2146,Comment,"I loved it. I lived there last year. 

Simple as that. Even though it's a smaller dorm, you'll have both girls and guys living in the building along with it being very social. When you're in the  other dorms, you'll meet a lot of people who didn't know the majority of the floor they lived on.  In Freeman, everyone knew everyone. 

I was in the boat as you and I even had to look it up on the map because I didn't even know where it is!! 

Ive found some of my best friends in the dorm, of which are my roommates in my apartment this year. I even met my girlfriend in Freeman too. 

If you're lucky, you'll get a bigger room but they all vary in sizes. Use the lofted beds to your advantage though and try to create space. 

Community wise, it's hard to beat. Sophomore and freshman who moved in when rooms opened up(often Greek members will move to their houses and spots will open up) loved it and enjoyed it more than where they were staying. (they were in willow, maple and towers). 

Location is also prime as you'll have two different dining centers to attend. Three if you include the memorial Union. We'd often switch up on where we were eating and or go to convos as its the closest when the weather was bad. You'll really enjoy this simple fact. Oh you can grill too. We ended up using the grills much more than I ever thought. 

Along with that, lied rec is near too and has much more space compared to state gym. You'll find it to be also much less packed too. 

To address your engineering concerns, my roommate and several others in the dorm were engineers and had no problem with the location. It's only a 10 minute walk and or you could just take the cyride. It's easy and nothing you should be worried about. 

Depending on the kind of person you are, you'll find people who enjoy the activities you do in Freeman, from gaming to partying and even working out. 

Freeman hall will provide you with the college dorm feel you're looking for. 

I honestly wouldn't worry that you've been assigned Freeman, in fact.. I think you're in a pretty good position and should have a great year being there.

2151,Comment,"I didn't need ISU's permission to collect the data since I wasn't breaking any rules (just walking around buildings and removing carcasses), although I did have to obtain a state/federal permit to do it. I wouldn't be surprised if they weren't aware of the issue or possible solutions. Most people just let birds hit their windows at home, too.

I think the biggest problem with taking it into account is that current architecture favors these glassy buildings - natural light is 'in.' Using bird-friendly windows from the start would be best, but some people don't like how they look. Retro-fitting old buildings with applications is expensive (both material and labor-wise). 

Personally, I like how glassy buildings look, and I can see how building those sorts of structures over in engineering land help bring in new students. But also, if I were a prospective student on a tour of the school and saw tons of dead birds on the sidewalk, I wouldn't be super into it.

> It was kinda a odd day today I saw that at the student innovation center then going to Freddy‚Äôs for lunch there was a woodpecker who had obviously ran into the the big picture windows of that meeting room above cvs.

Not odd at all, relatively. The spring migration is in full swing right now, so more birds will be hitting windows. Once you see your first dead bird, you won't be able to stop.

**Side note, for anyone that finds a dead bird: take a photo of it for me, and PM me with the photo and exactly where you found it. It would be super helpful for my records, and also for planning where to monitor this fall.**",1,14,,g78n5h,t1_fogkxzd,/r/iastate/comments/g78n5h/student_innovation_center_vs_birds/fognfd7/

2202,Comment,"I wish that all of the online classes had recorded lecture videos. I know a lot of students and also professors have inconsistent WiFi which makes lectures over Webex/Zoom super hard. If a student‚Äôs WiFi is out they miss the lecture entirely, if their connection gets bad for a brief period of time, they miss out on potentially important information. It‚Äôs really a terrible way to have a lecture happen. My favorite class has lecture videos posted that were recorded during in person lectures last year (I know that‚Äôs not feasible for most classes because time travel doesn‚Äôt exist, but lecture videos in general are good), a downloadable version of the lecture slides if you want to follow along and take notes on that, and a q&a webex meeting that is optional to attend each week. I think this is the best format and helps me learn the easiest. The only downside to this class is that I can‚Äôt speed up the videos. Having videos on YouTube or another platform that makes it easy to speed up or slow down is super helpful to me as sometimes I get bored during lectures if the professors talk slowly. Speeding it up helps to keep myself engaged in the content

Edited to add: also the counseling sessions available to students should not have a restriction on how many sessions each student can have. I think this rule is ridiculous especially right now. Some people don‚Äôt have insurance or their parents won‚Äôt let them get a counselor outside of the university. There should be unlimited sessions available to students who want them.",2,16,,j2py5k,t3_j2py5k,/r/iastate/comments/j2py5k/how_could_we_make_spring_semester_less_awful/g77shlb/

2206,Comment,"To be frank, Iowa State ME advisers are pretty terrible. I was at the other end of the spectrum. My grades weren't great, but there was an interest in what I was doing. It made me stick around for around 6 years in total.  Things are going well right now though. I'll add on my two cents as an addition to OP in terms of ""no matter what, you can do it"".

&#x200B;

At one point there was an adviser ask me how it was expected for me to get a job. Well, 2.2 GPA got an internship right after. Then another, then one with that same company as the second time. I became a TA with my experience, got relationships with professors.

&#x200B;

I stayed around town one summer and worked for Cafe B. I bartender at mothers and hung out with grad students at thumbs. I got drunk and met an old electrical engineer who contracted me to help him make an industrial turn table. The governor was there when we installed it for a ""we are bringing back industry"" speech. It was kind of ridiculous.

&#x200B;

I don't think an Iowa State adviser would find much merit in my path, at least they didn't while it was happening. From making beer dip n' dots with a professor, going out with my English professor's daughter to prom, having frequent lunches with my econ professor, carting around liquid nitrogen in a slightly untightened thermos to sophomore design, college had its merits.

&#x200B;

Be interesting, care about people and care about what you do. Friends you make at the bars often become the friends help you out at 2 am on Wednesday night prepping for a test. Build support groups, find friends, make stories. I never researched the companies I worked for. I just talked to them.

You've been advocating snacking on fast food, pizza, chips, pop, all things that at are terrible for your health.
The UDCC's food is very healthy, provided you eat the right things.

I had club meetings, study sessions, parties, etc. that I went to as a freshman, the thing you do is simply plan ahead and eat your meals around them, because (as I have been saying) the amount of food you get from those engagements is never very substantial. If you have too many meals, you can get a to go meal and store it for later.

So the more meals you get per week, the smaller the meal will be, but the cheaper it will also be. So 14 meals would be fine, because you could store any extra meals in your fridge. Therefore no need for extra snack food.

2271,Comment,"Short answer: yes, but.

The ""but"" is that we have jurisdictional limits on what we can do with the Greek organizations.  Their houses are not ISU buildings, nor on ISU land, so we have limited direct oversight and enforcement.  For example, because their housing contracts aren't with us, we can't automagically move them from normal room assignments to isolation/quarantine the way we can with students who have ISU residential contracts.  

(Edit: That does not, of course, apply to the Greek members who *are* living in the res halls.  The above is specific to the fraternity/sorority houses.)

Having said that - the Dean of Students Office has a Greek Affairs unit that liaises with all of the Greek orgs.  They've been working with both the local chapters and the national organizations all summer to provide guidance, help them develop plans, and ensure they're tied in on the Cyclones Care campaign and aligned with our residential policies.  The national-level organizations are more concerned about this than the behavior of members on a local level may suggest.",1,7,,i1de58,t1_fzzi0n0,/r/iastate/comments/i1de58/i_just_completed_move_in_and_covid_testing/fzzj6yh/

2284,Comment,"This is tough.  A lot of the problems people have with math is that they have had bad math teachers.  I see this all the time where I go and observe people teach who give ridiculous explanations as to why things must be true which are outright false, and then to make matters worse they can then bully students who question the explanation.  This leads to a lifetime of thinking math is stupid and makes no sense.  So it is ideal to have good teachers who love the subject and are familiar with the subtleties.

That aside, the key to liking it is to step back and understand what math is about.  Math at its core is about solving problems and understanding patterns.  Some of these problems are computational (for example, calculus basically is about two problems:  How is something changing? and What is the total?), but there can be other problems.  Here is a famous problem which only got solved in the last few months:  Which pentagons (five sided polygons) can be used to tile a floor?  It turns out that there are essentially [15 patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagonal_tiling).  This is a math problem, and one of the amazing things is that a housewife with no mathematical ""training"" discovered several of these by themselves.

Also solving Sudoku is very mathematical, these are logic puzzles and you have to have ideas weave together to be able to solve them.  And there is some interesting math involved in card tricks as well.

So I recommend that you look for patterns, and once you see a pattern ask yourself ""hmm, I wonder why there is a pattern here?"" and ""hmm, I wonder if I could explain this pattern?"" and ""hmm, I wonder if I could use this to find new patterns?"" and ""hmm, I wonder if I should go see a doctor about all my `hmm'ing noises I keep making?"".  Once you start asking any of the first three questions, you are on the road to becoming a mathematician!

2286,Comment,"Hmm. Well the first think is I would get rid of calling things ""Calc 3"" and change the name to ""Multivariable calculus"". But for more systemic changes I would say that if you were an engineer, I would want you to cover what we currently cover in these three courses (and we have a lot of engineers!).

If I weren't primarily teaching engineers, I would probably get calculus down to 2 semesters (leave calc 1 much as it is and then for calc2 work through a few basic integration techniques, some applications, then go into multivariable setting for differentiation and integration). The third semester I would make into a discrete math course as this is the direction that the world is heading and students are not getting enough of that material.",1,7,,i6qqq0,t1_g0xv1f9,/r/iastate/comments/i6qqq0/ama_with_the_calculus_coordinator_steve_butler/g0xw3ps/
2287,Comment,"A lot of people seem to think that ISU is acting like it's making money for shareholders or something. State schools are non-profit so its not like anyone is making a profit off owning it.

I'd guess that they have to make up money in places they have control over to offset that which they dont. The Iowa Legislature took away 4.5 million dollar from ISU (and Iowa I think) because they claimed they didnt have the budget for it. Not to mention the 4.5 million was taken back after it was given to ISU, so ISU was effectively in debt to the Legislature.

Its supposedly a zero sum game.

Most professors haven't gotten inflation raises for a while or other raises afaik. Additionally there have been a lot of new hires in departments that are growing quickly like Engineering, which doesnt help the budget (even though this is departmental, but the school as a whole kind of shares money but its complicated and has to do with research money etc.)

And there are other factors fo how funding works. Money donated to the school through private donors are required to be attached to a project or service. So when the football team got a donation for new helmets (not sure if that is a thing, but just as an example), that money couldn't be used for anything other than football equipment.

A lot of contracts for restaurants also ended, like Subway and Caribou. When the contract was done ISU dining decided it was cheaper to operate their own, that's why the MU is completely different and why the Hub is being renovated.

I agree the food isnt as good as it's used to, I especially miss Convos late night bundles. I am just trying to suggest possible reasons for why its happening.

I also agree it feels like a rip, especially since he required meal plans on campus.

I'd be more angry about how much spending is ultimately mishandled by people and if that is leading to monetary issues in the school.

Sorry for the long post, this is just some of the things I have heard from professors and other people who work as ISU.

> ‚Äú0‚Äù Points - Present: Showed up on time and worked through the entire work shift. Being on time means that you are clocked in, at your assigned station and ready to work at the start of your shift.

> ‚Äú1‚Äù Point - Tardy: Late to your scheduled shift (more than 5 minutes and less than 30 minutes), or left early without being dismissed. Out of uniform or out of the work area at the start of the shift, even if clocked in, will be considered late. Repeated tardiness and unscheduled absences may result in discipline up to and including termination.

> ‚Äú2‚Äù Points - Call, No Show (CNS): Call your facility at least 1 hour prior to the start of work shift and speak to a manager, report that you are unable to work a shift. No emails or text messages will be accepted. Unanticipated illness, tardy over 30 minutes, or Performance issues also fall into this category of points earned.

> ‚Äú3‚Äù Points - No Call, No Show (NCNS): Not calling at least 1 hour prior to a work shift and not showing up to work the shift. Performance issues may also fall into this category of points earned.

Unexpected illness would fall under section 2 unless your friend failed to inform them at least 1 hour before the shift.  This policy is in place to ensure management can fill the vacancy.

This is covered during orientation, and every employee is given a printed copy of the handbook.  It is also publicly available at the link above.

Also if im going to he honest the students dont actually do that much baking. They do a lot of weighing out of ingredients and portioning things like cookies and cupcakes. (Coming from the one person that ive talked to there, and just walking through).

The pay rate for the bakery will be $12 an hour starting july 1st i believe. This is a dollar more then dining centers and cafes. But as someone said they do have a weird schedule, and i do not know if students are apart of this.

2344,Post,"I purchased the silver dining plan assuming that the dining hall situation would not have been set up as poorly as it was this semester. I, along with about 10-15 of my friends that I know, have over 90 swipes/flex meals left over. I dont know when they expire, but I know that you can use as many flex meals in one order as you want. We are considering recruiting a large amount of homeless people and ordering 90+ meals with our flex meal and giving them out. 

It is the dumbest thing that the swipes expire each semester. Now I was well aware of this the previous years, but we purchased my plan pre-covid and didnt expect the very poor management of the dining halls to turn out how they did, so none of us went to them and ended up just going to hawthorn or somewhere to use a flex meal. We didnt find enough outlets of time to keep eating lance and ellies, hot food, etc to get rid of all of our swipes. I believe this would be a great revolt to the poor choice made by ISU Dining due to covid, and this would be within policy and could be for a very good cause.

This post is merely to gather thoughts of others that may work for ISU Dining, or have a similar experience with all these leftovers swipes which can equal up to thousands of dollars.  

tldr: covid made most students with dining plans left over with way too many swipes to lose at the end of the semester. we should use them for a bunch of meals and give them all to those in need to revolt against this poorly planned expiration of meal swipes during a global pandemic",5,98,0.95,k2zpil,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/k2zpil/using_the_stupid_isu_dining_swipes_policy_for_good/

How is that going to be a challenge to get enough calories? 

And I still can't grasp how you think that an all you can eat buffet twice a day is going to be 100% super healthy whereas any other meal someone eats at any other location is going to be super unhealthy. You can make healthy or unhealthy choices either way. Only one of these do you have to pay up front and still pay if you don't use it.

As for cooks, you can be a literal felon and 99% of ames kitchens will hire you without a second thought. Thats not hyperbolic, I've seen my old coworkers' rap sheets on Iowa courts online and *wow*. For context,, I've worked at varying types of ames restaurants (hickory park, aunt maudes, Boulder taphouse). Regardless of what the exterior is, the kitchen rule still applies. 

All that said, I honestly can't really blame ISU here. Yes there's higher paying competition, but that competition usually has more responsibilities or is more demanding then an ISU dining job. There is an upper bound to the logical pay rate here.

2382,Comment,"Absolutely, it would be great if we came up with some form of calc-roulette which randomly put people together to study (maybe we should be doing a bit of that inside of the recitations; hmm, could be fun). One thing we do have planned is to bring back quizzes (they were suspended at the end of last semester) and we have a set of practice quiz problems that help prepare people for the quiz which will give people the fun experience of trying to figure problems out.

The difficulty might be toned down a bit because I am not writing problems; but it is still sufficiently challenging to get people to learn. As for the pace, we will more or less go at the same pace we always do and intend to cover everything that we would have normally covered (with one less exam).

As to your final question. I do remember some students, but not many. One of the things that I have discovered over the years is that I have a hard time with recognizing people's faces. After 20 years of knowing my partner (15 of which we have been married), I can now almost reliably pick her out of a crowd. But for the first 5 years, that was not always the case. Usually I was able to go off of the fact that my partner was a short Chinese woman which helped her to stand out in a crowd. But then I once had to meet her at the airport in Shanghai, where there were LOTS of short Chinese women, and I only succeeded in that when she was about 15 feet away she started waving at me (a good clue). The other challenge recently is that I have been involved in large classes which means I get to work with more students, but also seems to make the individual connections less.

I do not want people to read the preceding paragraph and get the impression I don't care about the individual, I really do care, and I am trying my best to help as many people as I can. I am getting better all the time with remembering people.",1,11,,i6qqq0,t1_g0xwl1f,/r/iastate/comments/i6qqq0/ama_with_the_calculus_coordinator_steve_butler/g0y1loi/

I‚Äôve contacted many people including my supervisor and have been redirected over and over. The last bit of information I got was that the Heaping Plato was doing carry out only. But the ISU website contradicts this because it says that the heaping Plato is closed for the rest of the semester.

Before we left on break I and my fellow coworkers were asked and given the option to be placed at other locations so that we can get our regular hours. We were asked what days we‚Äôd be back and how many hours we would like and they told us that they would find other shifts for us to work. That was several weeks ago and I haven‚Äôt heard anything back. It‚Äôs not that I‚Äôm looking to work I‚Äôm just trying to get this information so I can figure out my next steps.

This lets you take advantage of convenient, buffet meals or quick bundles at the MU- think about what you'll do for lunch between classes. However, unused meals suck. I believe meal blocks (not meal plans) roll over to the next semester which helps. You can always buy another meal block.

Another thing to remember is that eating a bagel and fruit breakfast in your room is waaaay cheaper (and faster) than a ~$8-9 dining hall breakfast.

I am a recent Iowa State Graduate, and I am thinking about opening an Esports Center.  At this Center it would function similar to a Lan Cafe during regular business hours.  During evening hours there would be tournaments, watch parties, and specific game events.  We want to create a hub for competitive games in the Ames Community.

Bellow are some questions that I hope the community could help me with.

What games would you like to have access to?

Would you attend regular hours business?

Would you attend tournaments?

Would you attend watch parties?

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-
Express meals to flex meals
For fall 2018, we're making express meals even more flexible. Instead of locking you in to an entree, sides and drink, your swipe will be worth $9! Want two sandwiches? Go for it! Maybe you want all sides? Okay!

Express meals will be called flex meals and you can use them at all the places you currently use express meals with the addition of Lance and Ellie's!


 
Living on campus next year? Check out your meal plan options!
CyFlex is our newest meal plan for fall. You get 220 meals per semester and can use 10 per week as flex meals in retail locations. CyFlex also has dining dollars.

Cyclone and Cardinal offer anytime access to our dining centers along with flex meals and dining dollars.

Gold has 200 meals a semester in our dining centers, flex meals and dining dollars.

Plans will be available to select on AccessPlus in June.

Living off campus?
Let us make life a little easier
(and more delicious)!
You can choose any of our on-campus meal plans. Or, you can select our Silver or Bronze plans where all meals can be used in either the dining centers or as flex meals in retail locations. Silver and Bronze also come with dining dollars.

Still not quite the right fit? Build your own plan with meal blocks, dining dollars or both! Choose the plan that's right for you on AccessPlus. Plans will be available to select in June.


 
MU FOOD COURT
Summer renovations will bring a whole new look to you this fall, along with a new center island eatery called, The Mix.

The Mix will be a build-your-own salad concept, offer hot daily specials, soups and more!

We'll be bringing in an all-new chicken concept and refreshing some of your favorite spaces along the way with a new look.
 
CLYDE'S
Yes, the grilled cheese is coming back along with burgers, sandwiches and a We Proudly Serve Starbucks that will open in the fall!

Clyde's sits near the site of the former Clyde Williams' Field where the Cyclones played until 1975. Clyde Williams was a Cyclone football coach, athletics' director and he started our basketball program. Pretty cool piece of history!

THE HUB
Opening in November 2018, the Hub will be completely re-designed to improve line flow and bring you two new concepts.

The Roasterie premium coffee cafe will offer a full line of mochas, lattes, blended drinks, teas, specialty coffees and more.

Heaping Plato will serve a Mediterranean-inspired menu that features fresh-made pitas filled with your favorites.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî END

As every year it seems the meal plans seem to be less and less appealing.  Also, is it just me or does the hub paragraph make it sound like they will be removing Caribou?

2446,Comment,"Awww.  Thank you.  It's nice to be appreciated.  :)

I joke about the consequences... mostly.  I've somewhat-accidentally put myself in a weird grey area here.  I'm clearly identifying myself as an ISU employee, and hence someone with ""official"" knowledge, but I'm also being very clear that I'm not writing as an authorized representative of ISU.  That gives me certain freedoms that [the official accounts](https://web.iastate.edu/social) don't have - for example, I can engage in marginally-witty banter with /u/CAPTAIN_SUPREME because I don't have to maintain *total* professionalism.  But because I put myself out here as an ISU employee rather than just some dude, everything I say still reflects on the university.  Thus, if I were to say something that damaged the university's image or undermined the agreed-upon official message, I would likely face consequences.

FWIW, my boss knows I'm doing this and is okay with it; he considers student engagement part of my job.  The PIOs know I'm doing this and are also okay with it (as long as I stay in my lane).

2478,Post,"After four straight years of constant academic warfare, this week I had basically nothing going on. I don't have any more finals, I have one more assignment total, I'm not working any more... And I thought I should take some time to just walk around campus and poke my head in some of the buildings I had never been to before,  as I had previously been confined largely to the engineering buildings on the west side of campus, given this would be my last opportunity to do so (Unless I drove several hours just for the purpose of doing that, of course).

There's so much cool stuff here! Cool architecture, cool art, cool research wall posters, surprise green spaces, epic views, cool plants, grand statues, awesome balconies, magnificent overlooks, extremely academic looking staircases... And I only got through probably not even ten buildings. I'll only have part of tomorrow for the others, on top of everything else I need to do, so there's no way I'm going to see everything this campus has to offer.

Like, it really is beautiful here when you're not constantly fighting for each extra minute of time. I didn't know we funded studies into meme psychology. I didn't know we had a puppetry lab. I didn't know we published several different magazines. I didn't know how grand the views were from the top of Heady Hall. I didn't know that Durham had a subbasement. I didn't know that the stairstep side of Agronomy hall was a vibe in the rain. I didn't know about the gratuitous balconies and overlooks in Gerdin. Or the extent of the laboratories in the Food Sciences Building. I didn't know we had an entire section dedicated to wine research!

And that's what I found in just a few hours, in just a few buildings. Who knows what else is out there that I won't have the time to find...

Now that I finally stopped to smell the roses, I'm just kinda sad I'll never get to smell them all, I guess. If I had known how much cool stuff there was everywhere, and if I had the time, I would have explored a lot more.",19,154,0.98,1coh150,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/1coh150/i_explored_some_today_it_taught_me_i_should_have/

It should *not* be a surprise that her dorm doesn't have AC, or that there's no dining hall in the building. All of that info is very clearly stated online. On your room assignment, it says in, big, clear text, ""No AC."" Have you never looked at your room assignment page on starrez????? 

(Also, having a room with AC will cost you a few hundred more. It's an upcharge. You can just use a couple fans and open the window. It's only for a few weeks). 

And every single dorm has a floorplan map online, plus there are campus maps online that show every single dining location. Pretty easy to find out how close you are to dining locations. 

Not to mention ‚ú®you could have changed your dorm‚ú® if you didn't like it. There's a crazy easy room swap process on starrez, and instructions on how to do it are online. It may be too late now though, because you were supposed to do this stuff months ago. You can manually choose exactly what room you want/in what building, as long as the room is open (it will show you open rooms). 

There may still be room change options available, but I'm unsure what that process would look like this close to the start of the year, or if anything would be available. You would have to research that elsewhere. 

You need to be more proactive in researching your school before you get there. Like...months before...",1,12,,15tz9ob,t3_15tz9ob,/r/iastate/comments/15tz9ob/closest_dining_hall_1_mil_away_for_real/jwntl39/

2503,Comment,"So, I suppose I'll go over a few things to keep in mind...

1. Obviously bring copies of your resume, something like 15-20 should be good.
2. Make sure your resume is easy to read within 30-40 seconds. Career fairs are more for face-to-face interaction, not standing around in silence and reading an essay. A lot of interviews are scheduled on the spot during the fair so the recruiters there mostly want the information that you're really passionate about and can talk to. I'm sure you could feel free to put together a slightly longer resume or example of work for any interviews that you schedule later on, you'll have more time in those personal interviews.
3. Be able to talk about everything on your resume as well, it's always nice to get a little bit of information on how a project went or learning experiences you've had throughout school so far. This sort of thing distinguishes you from other students who just kind of go ""so, hey what's your company about?""
4. On the same note, as was already mentioned have some research done on companies that you really want to get a chance to talk with. Recruiters know a good amount about their college recruitment programs and it's a really easy talking point to get the ball rolling and establish comfortable conversation. Even just asking questions like what kind of projects interns would expect to work on, what are the exciting things happening for interns/college new hires, etc. Obviously these talking points are a little more generic, so if you do see something on the company's site that you find interesting definitely bring it up.
5. While there will be plenty of companies there that are big names, feel free to stop by some of the less-visited booths if you have time. The worst-case experience with this is that you end up losing a resume, but you should have plenty of those ready anyway. I used to do this to warm up a little bit right when I got to the fair, it can just help you work out the kinks. Also, it just opens you up to another potential opportunity for an internship, which can be nice as a fall-back, especially since you're just a sophomore.
6. This one assumes you're a guy. At the very least, wear a nice shirt and tie. Preferably a suit. It's just kind of how people do stuff, such is life. I suppose if you really don't give a fuck, well then just don't care how you dress. But really, at least 90% of the employers there won't take you too seriously if you can't even take the time to put on a tie. Just like in dating, ""it's the thought that counts"" haha. If you're a lady....well, I have no idea, I'm in IT ;)
7. Almost forgot this, but make full use of the ISU Career Management Services site (if it's still called that). It's pretty simple to just upload your resume and take a bit of a shotgun approach honestly. This ended up getting me similar numbers of interviews as did physically going to the career fair. It only takes like an hour, so go for it.


So that ended up being longer than I expected, and I suppose I could probably write more. Lot of this just comes from being a previous student and now coming back to campus as a recruiter, which is kind of goofy but fun. I think if you get nothing else from this little essay is that you just **need to go out and introduce yourself**. I didn't do this enough as a student and so count myself lucky for the employment that I managed to get. Also, remember that recruiters are just regular people too. Most of them probably went out the night before for some beers or are planning to go that evening as well. Just have fun with it :)

TL;DR: ..and that's how I ended up naked on Welch Ave. Sorry for the long post haha.

Also, if you can, try and get more than just the last two hours of the fair. That's when people start to pack up. Most of the time if you ask professors don't care about you missing a class that day.

---

EDIT: Noticed you asking ""When I walk up and shake the recruiter's hand, what should I be saying?"" A good one is ""Hi, my name is <name>, I'm a sophomore in <major>."" Here's where you can either pose a question, ""could you tell me a bit about the intern experience at <company>?"" or go for the resume handover. Typically if you hand over your resume first, it opens up a little bit of an awkward pause where the recruiter will scan over your resume, but you just have to make sure to have a quick talking point ready to get out of the little pause. Either way can work, and sometimes recruiters will ask to look over a resume before much personalized chatter. It can kind of vary, but I would just suggest to always have a fallback question for the recruiter (again, something like the ""what would an intern expect here"") just to at least have a little back and forth and maybe give you a little time to get the conversation going.

I'd walk by and it would smell so goddamn good. I just thought you had to be a student to grab food from any of these places so I avoided them. I've lived in ames for almost 10 years so I'm burnt out on about every other place ames has to offer.

2530,Post,"At any point during the last year, have you looked at ISU's disaster response and thought, ""I could do better than that?""  If so, here's your chance to prove it!  Join the Honors Student Board and ISU Emergency Management for a tabletop disaster simulation.  You'll play the roles of ISU and Ames leaders in this discussion-based event, facing a scenario of a natural gas explosion in Friley Windows.  Based on an actual incident that occurred at the University of Nevada in Reno, this exercise will put you in charge of the immediate emergency response and the strategic planning for long-term disaster recovery.

**Who:** This is an HSB event but all ISU students* are welcome.  No prior knowledge of emergency management is required.

**When:** Monday, March 29, 4pm-6pm.

**Where:** 1151/1155 Jischke.  *This is an in-person event*.  Due to the format, there is not an online component.  

**COVID Precautions:** Standard classroom protocols apply: face coverings required, 50% capacity, don't lick other people's stuff.

**How:** Space is limited, so please RSVP at https://forms.gle/5afwkW7yLf2E2fFE7 to ensure you have a seat.

Sometimes you can look at the websites of the companies and they will list what is still available, but sometimes it is unclear, which is why I always call. Some good companies to start with would be First Property Management, Total Property Management, Hunziker Property, Triplett, etc.. Campustown Property Management has a lot of places in campus town, but they are a pretty shitty company and are fairly expensive, but don't rule them out. 

There are gonna be spots still open for the fall- people's plans change all the time. My apartment still hasn't been signed for this coming fall and we still do showings. 

Also: craigslist is great for people looking for apartments this late, and sometimes you can find a great sublease deal.

# Cyclones Care: It‚Äôs not just about protecting you, it‚Äôs about protecting all of us

**Video Script**

*Wendy Wintersteen (WW):*

Hello Cyclones! I‚Äôm President Wendy Wintersteen.

*Julia Campbell (JC):*

and I‚Äôm Julia Campbell, President of Student Government.

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre as excited as I am about being back in Ames to enjoy everything Iowa State University has to offer. But for our on-campus experience to be a success, we need your help to protect the ISU community.

*WW:*

The science is clear ‚Äî getting vaccinated is safe and effective, and the best way to prevent you from getting seriously ill.

*JC:*

And all Cyclones are encouraged to wear a face mask indoors, even if you‚Äôre vaccinated. It‚Äôs an important second layer of protection.

*WW:*

So can you please help us out and wear a mask in the classroom, lab, library, in line at the dining center, and all other indoor places where you‚Äôre around others‚Ä¶

*JC:*

Because it‚Äôs not just about protecting you, it‚Äôs about protecting all of us ‚Äì your classmates, friends, professors, and colleagues.

*WW:*

So, we encourage you to get vaccinated‚Ä¶

*JC:*

Wear a mask‚Ä¶

*WW:*

And let‚Äôs encourage each other to show how Cyclones Care about our community!",8,17,0.69,pbeypo,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/pbeypo/a_message_from_president_wintersteen_and_student/

2598,Comment,"That's a bit misleading since it includes all athletics. 

The basketball program, however, which is one of the two programs with very high salaries, is more than self sustaining. At most universities basketball and football pay for all the other sports. Most of those other sports usually dont have nearly as large of budgets, and they provide scholarship and athletic opportunities to many students, which i see as in line with the mission of most universities. 

If the basketball\football programs arent generating money, then the university actually stands to lose far more money. And thats before you consider the positive marketing value received by universities with successful athletics programs. That marketing value is worth many millions, as it has proven results in new student recruitment, alumni-connectivity and donor development and retention (for the university as a whole, not just for athletics funds) 

Also, the statistics in general you talk about are also heavily misleading. For example, student fees that often cover free or discounted student tickets. Yes, not every student may want to go, but i could say that about many of the fees i was charged for at ISU, and yet thousands of students go to athletics events, so probably one of the most popularly-supported fees in a university.",1,7,,22se45,t1_cgpymeh,/r/iastate/comments/22se45/hoiberg_gets_600000_raise_after_28win_season/cgq2gdv/

Recently, one of the people in our roommate group is deciding to move out, but is holding the room for now so we can potentially find a roommate instead of getting a random. So, if you are looking for a room in Freddy, this a great place to start.

About us and the apartment:

* Building 12, so we are super close to 2 bus stops.
* Single rooms!
* The 3 of us currently living there are very close, but very friendly
   * This also means we can be very loud at times, but we try to be as respectful as possible.
* All of us are engineers going into  our 3rd year and we all study quite a bit (2 AerE, 1 MechE)
* We're introverted and don't really party
* All of us are kind of weird so sometimes normal societal rules get thrown out the window.
* We try to be as respectful as possible of boundries and are always willing to talk out disagreements.

Due to ISU's rules, only those assigned female at birth can live with us. (Shoutout to u/Fr0gnutts for their help!)

Please dm me or comment if you think you might be interested in living with us! We would love to meet you.

Let's get to it.

*****

**Public Health Measures for Campus**

*Face coverings* are encouraged but not required for most areas.  They're required in specific spaces, including:

* public transportation (CyRide; Transportation Security Administration requirement)

* Ames Laboratory facilities (U.S. Department of Energy requirement)

* healthcare settings, including Thielen Student Health Center

* areas of the College of Veterinary Medicine where they're normally required

* research laboratories, as determined by principal investigator or lab supervisor

*Vaccination* is encouraged but not required.

**Background** 

* [Policy direction from Iowa Board of Regents](https://www.iowaregents.edu/news/board-news/statement-from-president-mike-richards-lifting-regents-state-of-emergency), issued May 20, 2021

* [Iowa House File 889](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ba=HF%20889&ga=89), enacted May 20, 2021.

* [ISU senior leadership memo to campus](https://www.president.iastate.edu/communications/messages/2021/8/10-fall21), issued August 10, 2021

* [ISU Provost's memo to faculty](https://www.provost.iastate.edu/policies/provost-s-office-communications/ay2021-22-svpp-communication--1--fall-syllabus-statements-and-faq), issued August 10, 2021

*****

**Public Health Status**

It ain't where we were last November, but it's a long way from being good.

Statewide, we are seeing an ongoing surge, almost exclusively the Delta strain.  Hospitals are low on space due to a combination of factors - new COVID cases, a backlog of elective or non-emergent procedures that they were trying to clear over the summer, and other seasonal illnesses.  This combines with a dwindling healthcare workforce (many people have decided to seek other professions because of fatigue and frustration) and a remaining workforce that is exhausted.

Locally, Mary Greeley Medical Center's numbers of admitted COVID patients have been up for the past month.  **In the past 7 days, 75% of new COVID cases in Story County have been from the 18-29 age range and 100% have been the Delta strain**.

*****

**Testing Status**

Currently, we do not have a mass testing site operating on campus.  If you're a student and symptomatic, you can schedule a test through Thielen Student Health Center - [go to their site](https://health.iastate.edu/) and hit the Appointments link at the bottom right corner of the page.

Iowa closed its TestIowa sites over the summer due to low positivity rates and low utilization.  The state's preferred testing methods today are to see your normal healthcare provider or to [pick up a home test kit](https://www.testiowa.com/en/) ([FAQ here](https://health.iastate.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FAQ-Public-Test-Iowa-Pick-Up-Site-7.16.21.pdf) - hooray, self-service saliva science).  Thielen Student Health Center is a pick-up location.  We also have satellite pick-up locations at Union Drive Community Center and the Memorial Union, though those aren't listed on the TestIowa site.

*****

**Vaccine Status**

Last Friday, August 13, the FDA and CDC issued final approval for immunocompromised individuals to receive COVID booster shots (third dose) of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine formulations, eight months after their second shots.  Immunocompromised people make up roughly 3% of the U.S. adult population - but account for 44% of hospitalized breakthrough infections (i.e., infections in vaccinated persons).

About an hour ago, the FDA and CDC [released a statement](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/08/18/joint-statement-hhs-public-health-and-medical-experts-covid-19-booster-shots.html) that third-dose boosters of Pfizer and Moderna will be recommended for the general population starting September 20.  As with the limited approval for immunocompromised individuals, the general population approval is for eight months after second dose, so healthcare personnel will be the first to receive third doses.  We'd been seeing the same news reports as all of you but the official green light is very new, so at this time I can't say anything more about how we'll handle that on campus.

At this time, there's no official statement on a booster dose for people who received the J&J vaccine.  Stay tuned for more news.

On campus, we continue to offer vaccination clinics with Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson formulations.  [See my previous post for the current schedule](https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/ozcliq/fall_21_covid_vaccination_clinics_more_dates/).

*****

**Perspective, and What You Can Do to Help**

Unpopular opinion up front: everything I'm hearing from public health colleagues who study epidemiology indicates that we are unlikely to ever eradicate COVID-19 completely.  A more realistic goal is reducing its transmissibility to a point that normal public health controls can manage individual cases or local outbreaks before they generate mass hospitalizations or deaths.

That hinges on vaccination.

All of our previous public health measures - face coverings, online classes, canceled football games, social distancing, salad bar sneeze guards in front of podiums - all of those efforts were to buy us time for vaccine development and deployment.  Remember all of the ""flatten the curve"" graphics from spring of '20?  We made that happen.  We weren't stacking bodies on Mary Greeley's loading dock and we didn't have to turn Lied Rec into a field hospital - not because COVID wasn't so bad, but because enough people complied with the protective measures that we did hold back the tide.

For the last year and a half, we as a country have done a crappy job of managing the mental health aspect of this disaster.  America's mental health apparatus was a traveshamockery before COVID.  Now I fear we're going straight from a COVID pandemic into a mental health epidemic, [especially for you and other students across the country](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/08/17/suicidal-ideation-rise-college-aged-adults-due-covid-19-pandemic).  In studies of disaster survivors' mental health, we see that they have better short- and long-term outcomes if they're given agency and a list of productive actions to take.  ""Stay home and stay away from people"" was pretty much the geometic opposite of that.

**Getting vaccinated is the number one thing you can do to protect yourself and others**.  If there was ever a case of ""it's not about you,"" this is it.  No, vaccination is not a 100% guarantor of never getting COVID - but that shouldn't be news because *no* vaccine is 100% effective.  However, it:

* reduces your chance of catching COVID;

* reduces your chance of severe symptoms if you do catch COVID; 

* reduces your chance of transmitting infection to others; and

* reduces the likelihood that high transmission rates will generate a mutation that's worse than Delta.

The other part of this is to change the conversation around vaccination so it becomes a social norm.  ISU can't require you to disclose your vaccination status (see the link above to HF 889 for the reason why).  The current interpretation of that is that as ISU employees, my colleagues and I can't even ask the question.  *But you can.*  You can ask your friends and classmates and partners about their vaccination status (and, without making this a conversation about sex and dating, vaccination status might be one of several things you might want to know about a potential hookup...).  You can help make vaccination something that is expected - ""when did you get vaccinated?"" rather than ""are you vaccinated?""

The tricky part - and my hypocrisy knows no bounds here, because my frustration often exceeds my patience and compassion these days - is making it a non-judgemental, non-accusatory conversation.  Public shaming can feel satisfying in the short term but it rarely brings about the behavioral change we desire, and if it does, that change comes with undesired baggage.  If someone has concerns about side-effects or needle anxiety, you can help them through that (or /u/CycloneHealth can).  If someone has bad information about vaccination, you can provide them more current and accurate data points.  This, by the way, is also a part of the mental health issue I mentioned above - for both you and them.  Let's stop marinating our brains in cortisol.

There are other things you can do, too.  Face coverings are currently recommended indoors, even for fully-vaccinated people, and I'm pretty sure many of you stuffed them in your underwear drawers rather than throwing them away.  Now is the time to consider pulling them back out (and washing them - ew) and bringing them to class with you again.  Weigh the real value of the 801 Day Superspreader Sausagefest - you can get just as drunk at a smaller gathering where you can actually hear the conversations.  And don't lick door handles or other people's stuff.

*****

As always, I'm being as open as I can, but there's stuff going on behind the scenes that I can't talk about - unannounced decisions, confidential healthcare information, plans we've committed to executing but are still working on implementing.  Please remember that a lot of really smart people are working on this thing every day.  It may be happening out of sight but it is happening.

Thanks for reading.  Please hug (consensually) a custodian or a Student Health employee the next time you see them.

2615,Comment,"This is a tough question for me, as I consider myself very much an introvert, life in solitude kind of person.

My suggestion is look for people who share your interests, as an example there are many clubs our there you can go find one that matches your hobbies and you are bound to find people which you can relate with.  Similarly there are many free events and you can go to them and when you sit down or are waiting in line you can turn to the person next to you and say ""hello"", usually polite conversation ensues.

A second suggestion is look for people who share your challenges, and by this I mean your classmates.  There are people all around you who are going through the same shared experience and going through it together can help out.  Around test time is a good chance to turn to the people sitting next to you and ask.

Your situation is not unique, and by this I don't mean to make light of what you are dealing with, but to emphasize that there are others around you that crave the same interaction with people.  If you can step up and start the conversations then you will find it works well.

On a side note I was at Destination Iowa State this Fall and one of the people shared an experience how when he was a freshman he went over to the MU and saw there was a girl sitting at a table, asked if he could sit down at the same table, and then they had a nice conversation.  And after that he never saw her again.  For him it was a positive and memorable experience.  Some interactions will be one-off events, and some will lead to longer-lasting friendships.  But you will never know unless you start.

2627,Post,"I started writing this as a comment on another thread, but I just kept going and going and decided it would be cool to hear other peoples stories.

I was in the class of 2022, 4 years. My freshmen year was normal. My sophomore year came around, and I was having a blast. I had just switched my major, and things were going pretty well for me. Then, spring break hit, and I never came back.

Junior year was awful. I was back on campus, but everything was online, so I don't even know why I bothered living in Freddy. Also, the two month winter break was fucking wild.

I will say, I did get to experience a bunch of things that while I'll hopefully never experience again, were cool, and I'll have a lot of stories to tell.

When I came up for a weekend to pack up my apartment, my roommate and I went on a walk. It was so erie. Nobody was around. We walked down an empty Welch avenue on a Saturday night.

Also, I managed to get sent to quarantine housing. It was nuts. Two people showed up and moved me into oak elm. I got food delivered every morning, and I was also allowed to leave for ""15 minute outside walks with my mask on"".

This was January and it was freezing. I did not go on any walks. ISU dining also paid me for my missed shifts, which I appreciated

I only had one lecture that I was supposed to attend synchronously, and it was at like 2pm. Time no longer had meaning.

My first day there I slept through food ordering time without realizing it, so I just... only ate their provided peanut butter crackers. I apparently had too much social anxiety to realize I could have called them and explained I needed food.

The next day they called to check in on me, and I joked that I would be setting an alarm to remember ordering food from now on, I was then told off for not telling them I had no food.

So there I am, sitting at the table facing the drink machines against the right wall as you walk in, and this student walks up to the cup rack. He grabs a cup from wide variety of options and proceeds to pour water into said cup. To this day, I have no idea what was going through this kid‚Äôs head, but the mf whole ass *tosses the cup in the air* trying to flip it and catch it, but instead, he fails to grab hold after it comes back down and water goes fucking everywhere. To say I was struggling to retain my laughter would be an understatement.

2) Is it easy to meet people/make friends if you have an apartment rather than a dorm?

3) I'm having trouble understanding dining dollars or CyCash or whatever and Meal Plans. What are they used for? If I run out can I replenish it and/or if I still have some by the end of the year, do I get refunded?

4) Any good biking trails on campus? Would it be better to bike from the frederiksen apartments to the chemistry building?

5) I went to Transfer Orientation and signed up for classes, and I'm trying not to panic because I've always planned my schedule around highly rated professors on ratemyprofessor (and it's been a fantastic way to do it, because I tend to excel when my professors are actually good at doing their jobs), but there are no teachers assigned to any of the classes. They're all TBA. Can I switch if I end up with a horrible teacher or need the class at a different time?

# Cyclones Care: It‚Äôs not just about protecting you, it‚Äôs about protecting all of us

**Video Script**

*Wendy Wintersteen (WW):*

Hello Cyclones! I‚Äôm President Wendy Wintersteen.

*Julia Campbell (JC):*

and I‚Äôm Julia Campbell, President of Student Government.

I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre as excited as I am about being back in Ames to enjoy everything Iowa State University has to offer. But for our on-campus experience to be a success, we need your help to protect the ISU community.

*WW:*

The science is clear ‚Äî getting vaccinated is safe and effective, and the best way to prevent you from getting seriously ill.

*JC:*

And all Cyclones are encouraged to wear a face mask indoors, even if you‚Äôre vaccinated. It‚Äôs an important second layer of protection.

*WW:*

So can you please help us out and wear a mask in the classroom, lab, library, in line at the dining center, and all other indoor places where you‚Äôre around others‚Ä¶

*JC:*

Because it‚Äôs not just about protecting you, it‚Äôs about protecting all of us ‚Äì your classmates, friends, professors, and colleagues.

*WW:*

So, we encourage you to get vaccinated‚Ä¶

*JC:*

Wear a mask‚Ä¶

*WW:*

And let‚Äôs encourage each other to show how Cyclones Care about our community!",8,17,0.68,pbeypo,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/pbeypo/a_message_from_president_wintersteen_and_student/

2705,Comment,"So on that timetable that I linked to you, those are all called timepoints. If you were to follow the route along the map starting over on the east end, you'll see little square marks throughout the map. 

https://www.cyride.com/maps/school-year-maps/individual-pdf-maps/9-plum-map

Each of those square marks is a timepoint, which is what you're looking for on the timetable. This is what time the buses depart from the stop, so make sure she's there about 1-2 minutes early so she doesn't miss it.

For example, the second timepoint on the timetables that I gave you is S.16th and S. Grand - that is the stop in front of the Grove (or across the street from the Quarters.) The bus leaves that stop at 6:58am, 7:18am, 7:38am, etc. Those are the times that she would want to be at the stop to board it.

You can see other timepoints like Kildee Hall and Friley Hall - say she is boarding over near the Design college, she would want to use the Kildee timepoint and add about a minute. 

So to answer your question, yes you use the same timetable, and that will give you all of the times that the bus will depart each timepoint. Since it goes in a loop, if you follow the first row of timepoints, you'll notice that the first trip leaves Buckeye at 6:55am and returns around 7:27am.",1,3,,15qvdii,t1_jwfio21,/r/iastate/comments/15qvdii/cyride_fall_2023_update_welcome_and_welcome_back/jwfmg63/

As for an anecdote, I remember one day Ron was teaching a class, and in the middle of the class he started coughing and so stepped out of the class to go get a drink of water.

2760,Post,"I live in SUV and been buying a mix of meal blocks and some dining dollars for the past few semesters which worked perfectly for a random lunch on campus and a few things from the C-Store here and there, but then started to really think about it. 



When using a meal for Froots, Hawthorne or Clyde's, you're actually loosing money every time. I used to buy a 50 meal block, which was roughly $10.50 a meal, but a typical bundle at Clyde's or Hawthorne is like $8-$9, so you're losing ~$2 every meal you use. When using a bundle for Froots, you're spending $10.50 on a $6 smoothie, losing even more. The only instance where you're not losing money would be at Seasons/UDCC/Conversations where a meal cost $11 but if you buy enough Dining Dollars, you get a discount though, so even that evens out for the same cost.



So overall, you're going to save money on pretty much any meal bundle you use, have more freedom for your meals (Don't have to get 2 sides or can get whatever you want from the C-Store for a ""side"" instead for pretty much same price), and have the ability to use those extra dining dollars on whatever the hell you want.




In this post I use estimates, but I actually spent some time going through the actual numbers comparing a 50 meal block to equivalent dining dollars and the math checks out. This might not be true for the 25 meal blocks, but it should be even if anything. Also, the prices for blocks/DD can change so this might not be true for future years. Double check the math if you're hesitant and you should come to the same conclusion, just trying to help people out with this advice.",7,42,0.95,5797mz,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/5797mz/for_those_of_you_buying_meal_blocks_dont_buy/

If you can‚Äôt hear it how are you going to know that Brandon Flowers is Mr. Brightside. Actually I want to bring up the popularity of that song. Yes it is amazing. It is truly an auditory delight. Is it their best song? Well that‚Äôs an opinionated question. One that can only be answered by a fan that can name three of their albums. Which I can btw. (Hot Fuss, Sam‚Äôs Town, and greatest hits). I would say Mr. brightside is up there. Personally I think if you like the original you would love the sequel. Which is Miss Atomic Bomb. The music videos create a very compelling narrative that fleshes out the story of Mr. Brightside tremendously. So how could Mr. Brightside be the best if they made a sequel to clarify the lore of the first one. Therefore I believe the lore drop that is Miss Atomic Bomb to be the best song.

Here are the answers to your questions:

1. There is no course code. Really, I promise that there is no course code. Instead when you access MyMathLab through Canvas it will automatically link to your account. (Yes, I know that it keeps saying you need a course code, but I pinky swear that I have no course code to give you.)
2. Wow. I was not expecting this question. Hmm. Well, I did say this was an ""ask me anything"" so here we go. This is not my last semester ever with calculus, but it is the last semester as calculus coordinator and I will be taking a break from calculus for a while. Even this semester, I am not scheduled to write any of the problems (so no Butler problems). I will inevitably come back and teach more calculus in the future, but in the meantime I will be teaching other classes and working on various projects (I have some books to finish writing). As for calculus, there is a bright future ahead. We have someone scheduled to take over as coordinator who I have complete faith will do as well or better (if I thought that the quality would go down, I would not stop being coordinator). Beyond that, the math department has a great group of young faculty who are strong teachers, and I look forward to seeing what they do with calculus in the future.",3,74,,i6qqq0,t1_g0xdk61,/r/iastate/comments/i6qqq0/ama_with_the_calculus_coordinator_steve_butler/g0xepmi/

2808,Post,"For the past few weeks, I have been noticing someone leaving their trash outside of the dumpster, in the parking lot, and strewn all around SUV. Each time, it was the same trash bags (great value). My boyfriend has contacted the CA, the SUV office, and apartment community manager concerning this issue. Also, we know who it is because they have left Amazon boxes with their name and address on it. Just a few minutes ago, I noticed another box (this time a Fedex box with the name and address cut out). Because I already knew who it was, I left the box outside their door to let them know this is NOT okay. However, the person had their window open and began yelling at me, calling me a ‚Äúbum‚Äù for looking through their trash. When I asked why they wouldn‚Äôt walk it to the dumpster (less than 50ft away), they said ‚ÄúWhy would I do that? I‚Äôm too pretty for that.‚Äù 

This is so unbelievably selfish, lazy, and inappropriate. It makes me so upset because I want to keep this community clean and safe, especially because there are children who live in this community. Does anyone have any advice or ideas on who I could reach out to that could genuinely do something about this and give this person a warning? I don‚Äôt think a CA reminding this person about community guidelines is enough to get through to this person.

2819,Comment,"I was a first time tutor this past fall semester and I had a blast. The interview process is beyond easy (realistically, you will almost certainly get the position you apply for, the school needs tutors pretty desperately). The actual position on the other hand was very fun. It's a maximum of 5 tutees per group now, every group meets once a week for 1.5 hours. You get an hour of prep time every week per class you tutor. This doesn't sound like a lot, but given a problem solving class, most of that hour will just be you reviewing topics and creating some practice problems. 

As far as an actual group session goes, it boils down to how well can you get your group to work with each other. If you can get your groups to be vocal, ask questions, dive deeper into topics, then they feel very productive and move smoothly. A lot of groups also enjoy more abnormal ways of teaching, such as little games, activities, Kahoots, etc. 

Pay is 15 an hour, and the only hard part about the job is making time for everything. If you can do that, I say go for it. It looks great on a resume, it helps you get a better understanding of topics along with your tutees, and you meet and grow close with some really awesome people.",1,2,,18ustod,t3_18ustod,/r/iastate/comments/18ustod/can_anyone_share_their_experiences_on_being_a/kg68wtj/

In the end its an engineering proposal. You are probably going to miss the boat on these natural gas generators. For every month youve been talking about them, generally those are on a 5-10 year track plan and they serve as a back up to a national lab which cannot lose power.

The best you might do is be a think tank to do a proof of concept for something smaller like a solar panel/wind and battery project.

If you have a kitchen, then get potatoes, onions, apples, pasta, oatmeal, bread, butter, cheese and the cheapest meat you can find.  All of these are very common/cheap depending on what you get, so get generic brands/bulk amounts.  You can also sub out the potatoes/pasta for rice or similar, they are your carbs.  

Oatmeal/flakes for breakfast,  
A sandwich with an apple for lunch,  
Pasta with your meat of choice w/roast potatoes and cheese/some of the meat mixed in.  

I spend about $20 a week on that with about $5 of extra spending money for some beer/snacks if I want them.  I've been eating this since 2016 and have lost ~50 lbs.

2865,Comment,"They would almost certainly have to have a separate warrant.  Warrants must describe with specificity the area to be searched.  I've dealt with dozens of search warrants and never seen a warrant cover both a home and a vehicle.  I've seen plenty of people's homes and cars being searched, but there is a warrant for each.  

A warrant is a piece of paper signed by a Judge authorizing a search.  The Judge is given both a warrant and an affidavit which describes the basis for the warrant request.  The warrant explains what specifically is to be searched, what they are authorized to seize, and what their basis for probable cause is.  So the police request a warrant for dorm room 6 in Larch Hall - they can't search dorm room owners car as well.  One of the main ways to attack a warrant is it being over-broad or not specific enough, and that is why there aren't general ""authorization to search all of John Does property"" warrants.",1,2,,1q2ty2,t1_cd97few,/r/iastate/comments/1q2ty2/another_friend_just_got_a_mip_charge_so_i_did_a/cd97vgx/

2936,Comment,"1) Yes, I taught Calc 2 last spring.  As for why it is dreaded I suspect that this is a reflection of the content.  Calc 1 and calc 3 tend to be classes which don't require extraordinary skills when it comes to algebraic manipulations.  On the other hand Calc 2 often does.  The reason for this is that differentiation turns out to be boring and easy in that there are a dozen rules to know and then you can pretty much differentiate any function we put in front of you.  Put another way, differentiation is fairly algorithmic.

Now turning to integration, there is a dark secret.  Namely, there are about 12 things we can integrate.  If you are not one of those 12 things we are stuck.  So what happens in Calc 2 is that you learn to take functions and rewrite them using combinations of algebraic and trigonometric properties to get to the point where you find an equivalent expression which you can integrate.  The problem is that this is less algorithmic and more of a form of art.  You have to know how to use a variety of tools.  This makes it harder to accomplish.  It makes it doubly hard for people who are weak in their algebra and trigonometry backgrounds (which are a surprising amount of people taking the course).

The other part of Calc 2 that tends to make people nervous are series and particularly Taylor series.  But these are beautiful and not ot be feared.  In essence what you learn in Calc 1 is that you can approximate any function by a line (which is a simple example of a Taylor series), but can we do better?  The answer is yes, we can find ways to approximate that locally match more of the function, i.e., match more derivatives at a point.

Overall Calc 2 doesn't have to be scary, just make sure your algebra and trig is solid.

2) No.

3) For Calc 1 students the key, as already mentioned above, is to know your algebra and trig.  Also make sure you know your basic derivatives and integrals.  These are your tools and the more tools you have the better.

4) I am always willing to write a letter, but keep in mind that in general the more that a professor know you in a one-on-one setting the better the letter will be.  A letter which reads ""This student took my class and got an A, it was hard class so they are probably good"" is not as strong as ""This student took my class and got an B, but they came to my office hours, I saw that they put in a lot of effort in their studies and were able to vastly improve over the course of the semester.  I also had a chance to talk with this student and they have some great plans for what they want to do and I think that this student has all the attributes that are needed....""

So as you start thinking about letter writers for the future take time to identify faculty that you connect with **and** that you know **and** they know you.  This might not be easy, but it is good.

Best of luck in Calc 2.  (You will find my calc 2 lectures recorded online which you can refer back to for alternative ways to see the material from your instructor.)",0,8,,71yh62,t1_dnecips,/r/iastate/comments/71yh62/i_am_a_steve_butler_ask_me_anything/dned378/

Most of the energy used by the university is not used as electricity, but as heat made in our power plant. Of the electricity we do need, we are pursuing that percentage of how much the solar farm can make. That does not mean that 37.5% of ISU's energy is coming from solar. Yes buying from this farm is a start, but that is not the problem nor the solution that we were discussing.",0,6,,pp2955,t1_hd0shjb,/r/iastate/comments/pp2955/the_voices_of_students_were_silenced_today_by_the/hd0thyx/

3008,Post,"Hello, I'm an ISU incoming freshman entering into the 2020 fall semester. From reading the posts about meal plans on this subreddit, I have learned that they're basicly a scam. People have recommended meal blocks and dining dollars, but which one is the better deal? I have no idea on how all of this works. I'm hoping to dorm in the towers so a meal plan isn't required. Here are my main questions.

1) Pros and Cons of Meal blocks

2) Pros and Cons of Dinning dollars

3) How much does it cost to buy a meal at all the dining halls with dining dollars

4) Overall, what do you do and which do you recommend and why

Just thinking about it kind of just makes me frustrated with how broken things are.  I remember when I had an on-campus job in IT my boss said we had to spend more money on things, since we had a surplus, and if we didn't spend the surplus money we'd have a lower budget than previous years. 

There was a class, CPRE 288, where they added a lot of ""entrepreneur-like"" components to the class, adding a lot more workload to it, and seemingly not related to the class at all.  One student told me that he heard it was because someone made a donation to the department with a condition that they add that component somewhere to the program.  It seems wrong that a private donation can change the course of a class, and I don't know if that's what actually happened, but the whole thing feels kind of sketchy.

There's so much wrong with financial scenarios, in higher education, in politics, and throughout the world.  It's just overwhelming to think about it and feel like it's impossible to change it.

3019,Post,"Hi, team.  Buckle up.  This is gonna be a long one and I'm tired and slightly undiplomatic tonight.

By now, you've undoubtedly seen [the first release of move-in testing numbers](https://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2020/08/07/moveintesting).  /u/pacmain1 already started [a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/i5lco2/22_of_isu_students_test_positive_for_covid19/) if you want to kick that around further.  What I'd like to share here is my observations on how things are working out at Lied Rec and what you can do to help yourself and my team have a low-stress check-in experience next week.

(Context, for those who don't follow me: as the flair says, I am ISU's emergency manager.  I am serving as ISU's Incident Commander for the move-in and testing operation at Lied Recreation Center, reporting to Erin Baldwin, ISU's overall IC for COVID-19, and Kristen Obbink, ISU's public health coordinator for COVID-19.  I have been at Lied Rec every day this week, along with over 100 other ISU employees who are there to make this process run as smoothly as possible, and I will be there all seven days of move-in next week.  *This is not an official ISU statement, all opinions are my own, and all observations are subjective.*)

*****

**First, some numbers.**

I won't duplicate the official release (above) on this week's testing.  However, I'll say that our busiest one-hour period so far was Monday, 8am-9am.  During that hour, we collected 187 samples for COVID testing.  That's a nose swabbed every 19 seconds.  

Today *almost* broke the record but we ""only"" had 181 people come through in the first hour.  Of those, 60 came through in the first 15 minutes (one nose every 15 seconds) and 131 in the first half-hour (4.4 noses per minute).

Swab Squad is *on fire*.  Leave no nose behind!

*****

**Now let's talk times.**

DOR's first block of move-in times is 8am-9am.  This is consistently our busiest hour at Lied Rec.  I suspect a lot of parents are insisting on getting there first thing in the morning.  This isn't actually helping them save time.  Even if you're in the parking lot at 7:05am when I drag-ass in, you won't get into the building until we open the doors at 8:00am.  I need that time for signing in workers, issuing radios and other gear, conducting a daily operations and safety briefing, and giving my unit leaders time to brief their volunteer crews on their duties.

I'm usually seeing a surge about 15 minutes before each time slot officially begins.  Again, I think a lot of people are trying to ""beat the rush"" but are winding up *being* the rush.  DOR and Health Services spent a lot of time on the scheduling to minimize lag and backups.  Please work with us to make things run smoothly. 

If you show up with all your stuff in order, and if you hit a crowd-free time, you should be in and out of Lied in 10 to 12 minutes (not guaranteed, but that is what I'm seeing and hearing).  If you arrive during any surge other than the opening crowd, you should still get through the process in no more than 20 minutes if you've done your homework.  If you are part of the early-morning crowd, it might take you 45 minutes to get from the back of the line to the exit.

The Lied Rec operation will shut down at 4:30pm on the 10th through 13th, and 1:30pm on the 14th through 16th.  My hospitality teams outside will begin striking their tents a little earlier than that, but the doors will remain open until the scheduled closure time.  After that time, the ISUCards and room keys will be moved to secure storage, the check-in computers will be shut down, and the Swab Squad will be out of their PPE and headed home for showers and margaritas.  Please be on time and don't make me the guy who has to hold 10 workers after closing because you can't follow a schedule.*

*This doesn't apply to the dude who rolled in three hours late today because of a blowout on the interstate, nor to the lady who bought her plane ticket before we announced the move-in times.  Both of y'all had legit reasons for showing up when you did and I am glad we were still there to take care of you.  No fault on either of you.

*****

**What's the homework assignment?**

I'm glad you asked!

First, if you don't yet have an ISUCard (student ID or ""red card""), you should have already emailed a usable photo to the Card Office.  ""Usable"" means no background and no Instagram/Snapchat filters.  If you failed to do this, you are unlikely to have an ISUCard waiting for you.  We can still get you through the process but it'll be slower for you, and you'll have to come back to get your ISUCard on a subsequent day.

Second, if you need to pick up your new ISUCard, *bring a valid government-issued photo ID*.  Driver's license and passport are the two most common; [here's the full list](https://www.isucard.iastate.edu/first-card-requirements).

Third, you were emailed [a pre-screening questionnaire](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/818e7bce542649699b4fb7ff86bf1bcb).  Fill it out and have the confirmation email ready to show us.  That ensures our database has your current contact information for your test results.  If you haven't done that, you'll be standing outside in an area with crappy wi-fi until you fill out the questionnaire on your phone and get that email.

**Pre-screening questionnaire URL:** https://app.smartsheet.com/b/form/818e7bce542649699b4fb7ff86bf1bcb

*****

**What if I'm not living on campus?**

Please don't come to Lied Rec.

Look.  We like you too.  But the Lied Rec operation is set up specifically to facilitate move-in for students living on campus.  We budgeted all of our resources, including personnel time - and, most importantly, COVID test kits - based on the number of active residential contracts.  If a bunch of non-resident students try to bandit the testing process, you're gonna burn out my teams and burn down our test kit inventory.  That doesn't help anyone.

If you want or need immediate testing, please contact [Thielen Student Health Center](https://www.cyclonehealth.iastate.edu/).  They'll work with you if you're symptomatic or exposed, or if you just want to check your status.  We're also looking at other ways to expand testing capacity for the broader campus community and we'll let you know if we're able to make that happen.

If you want your Cyclone Spirit‚Ñ¢ cloth face coverings, be patient and watch your ISU email.  We're working on the distribution plan for you and will announce *soon*.  We have enough for everyone *but we don't have them all at Lied Rec*.  

*****

**What if I want to come a day or three early?**

Please don't.

First, you may be assigned to a room that's still occupied from summer session.  DOR needs time to clean that room after the previous occupant moves out.

Second, the move-in days are spaced out so we can get your roommate's test processed, and (if they're positive) move them to isolation and clean the room, before you move in.  If you show up early and your roommate's test comes back positive, we have to consider you exposed.  That means you go to quarantine (either on campus or back home), even if your own test is negative.

*****

Thanks for reading.  We got through this week okay and we fine-tuned a lot of our processes to be as efficient and swift as possible, but we have seven straight days of operations next week.  Many of my personnel, including almost all of the medical staff and *everyone* from DOR, will be working all seven of those days.  After we shut down on the 16th, they'll be back on duty at Thielen or Helser or Beardshear the next day, ready to take care of y'all.  Please help me take care of them, and you, by keeping things running smoothly.",14,98,0.99,i5pag1,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/i5pag1/dispatches_from_district_19_lied_rec_report/

3063,Post,"Hey everyone, we're in the process of bringing the International & American Student Alliance (IASA), a student org at multiple universities across the country, to Iowa State and one of its biggest programs is English Clusters. This program provides free, non-credit English as a Second Language (ESL) classes to international students who want to practice/improve their English skills in a casual environment. These are typically led by students who are native (or at least near-fluent) English speakers and interested in volunteering to assist international students and/or gaining teaching experience.

Cluster topics can range anywhere from skill-based (i.e. pronunciation, writing for graduate students, reading) to topic-based (i.e. Southern culture, American movies) to casual conversation-based (i.e. discussion of current events, practicing English by playing games). While the teaching opportunities in this program are great for those studying to become English/ESL teachers or wanting to teach abroad, we still welcome those who are not. The type of Cluster that you would be able to lead (a more casual conversation hour format vs. one on pronunciation) will depend on your background, knowledge, and experience, but anyone from freshmen to graduate students can participate.

For the Spring, all of these Clusters will primarily be virtual and will go from mid-January through April. Clusters typically meet once a week for around an hour and there's a lot of flexibility for the day/time that they can be taught. In addition to these Clusters being open to all international students here, we're combining the English Clusters across all of the universities that our organization is at (Iowa University, Indiana University, Mizzou, etc.) this Spring since most things are virtual anyway. This means that an international student here can participate in a class led by someone at a different university, and vice-versa.

If leading one of the Clusters for this program sounds like something you might be interested in, visit uiasaa.com or dm me for more information!",0,17,1.0,jso2ce,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/jso2ce/volunteers_to_lead_english_as_a_second_language/

3066,Comment,"I'm a criminal defense attorney.  Yes, if a cop sees a bong in your home that can justify a judge signing off on a search warrant.  The discussion above regarding the legality of the police presence at the time of viewing the object may be relevant to the admissibility of evidence at trial, but probably not the original search warrant issuance.  For example, cop enters your home illegally, sees a bong - they can go get a search warrant based on that, but there is a good chance that whatever they find upon executing the search warrant will not be admissible in a trial against you.

Arguably there is an exception to the warrant requirement under the exigent circumstances exception - ie cops could enter your home claiming that you would destroy the evidence.  They certainly could detain you while trying to obtain a warrant, which would be unpleasant.  

Here is the #1 pro tip for all everyone - never talk to the police, never consent to anything (except possibly a blood breath test, I don't know IA express consent law).  All the above goes out the window if you tell the cops ""sure, c'mon in"" .... Those words are you throwing out your constitutional rights and waiving them.  

None of this is legal advice.  Also, if you are going to consume pot in a dorm, for the love of god use a vaporizer.  ",2,9,,1q2ty2,t1_cd8n1yb,/r/iastate/comments/1q2ty2/another_friend_just_got_a_mip_charge_so_i_did_a/cd8sueo/

It's pretty fun to explore, but I don't believe it has as great of a community as Helser does.
I believe Forker (Kinesiology building) is closer to Maple, Willow, and Larch. What's great about those res halls is that they're all connected to Seasons, which is probably the best dining center on campus. I've honestly never set foot in those res halls, but they seem decent.

 Hy vee and a few other pharmacies in Iowa are actually not getting vaccines from IDPH but straight from the CDC through the federal retail pharmacy program.  They then are distributing down to their local pharmacies.  This is why huge batches are popping up at some pharmacies as this supply chain does not intermix with the IDPH supply chain.

The disconnect is there but I don't think we have words for it yet (though countless electrons sure have been murdered in the attempt to describe it).  It's... negative social space.  It's the absence of intangible connections that we used to maintain as part of our daily routine, sometimes deliberately, sometimes just by being in a place, and we spent two years letting entropy overtake them.

You can eat healthy for $8 a meal and you don't have to pay it to ISU up front. Your eating decisions are your own responsibility whether it's at that all you can eat buffet or you're getting drunk food Friday night. 

And if you get 1 meal every single day you can stuff your face with 2000 calories if you wanted to and then just stave off hunger with the essentially unlimited pizza you get at these club meetings. Boom. $8 spent instead of $16. 


And also, yes it's easy to get on a bus and ride to a store. That's why I didn't stop there. There's a ton more that goes into grocery shopping when you live in a dorm, and that question had a 2nd part where it destroys your logic of how all that work to get and store groceries is easier than just ordering Jimmy Johns and having it delivered to you.

there are no windows or fire exits. 

i was charged $100 for ""paint damages"". my dad patched up the holes in my walls which i knew we had to do because it was mentioned when i first moved in, but no one  I know received moving out information, how were we supposed to know what paint to use? 

i received notice of the fee august 22nd and i sent out an email august 23rd. i was told the email was forwarded to the general manager on august 23rd but i am still waiting for a reply. On top of that, because I have been waiting for a reply I was also charged $24 total of late fees in the last two days and there is a transaction fee of $20 whenever there is a one time payment.

3202,Comment,"I am not involved with setting the admissions policy, so what follows is my own opinion.

I do believe that Iowa State does want to be accessible to a greater amount of people; and so in some sense they admit many students who on paper would normally not be accepted to a school with such a strong engineering program (among others).  Sometimes this does not go well for the students; on the other hand sometimes people take it to the next level and perform better than what a couple of numbers on transcripts say.

I don't know if I would use the word ""lax"", I would rather say that Iowa State is willing to take on a broader range of students with the goal of serving and promoting education in the state of Iowa (and beyond).

3203,Comment,"If you're living in a dorm, the one without air-conditioning in the rooms will have air-conditioned common spaces. Additionally all other buildings on campus are air conditioned as well so during a particularly hot day you can escape to those. 

It typically cools down significantly at night although the humidity doesn't go away, keep track of the humidity and temperature and open your windows when it gets cold or dry outside to keep your indoor temps nice. Additionally do not open your blinds during hot days as this will have a SIGNIFICANT effect on heating by the sun especially with a sun facing window.

The temperature typically become very pleasant a few weeks after the semester starts and currently, it's not forecasted to exceed 80F before the end of the semester so not much of your time spent here will be ones you'd typically need AC for.",1,4,,134mc2l,t3_134mc2l,/r/iastate/comments/134mc2l/incoming_international_student_how_important_is_ac/jiftw3c/

3208,Post,"I had a date yesterday, and I tried a new restaurant: Applebe‚Äôs on Chestnut Street. This is my first time at this particular Applebee‚Äôs  and I wanted to give a brief review.

The first place they went wrong was the tablets that you are supposed to be able to order from at the table. Ours was broken. Maybe the battery was just dead. Regardless of the cause, it was very disappointing, and I had to place my order through an incompetent waiter. He was a little bit awkward to be honest. Fortunately he did not try to make small talk, but all of our interactions with him were a little uncomfortable. But once our drinks came everything got better. I had the raspberry lemonade and it was TO DIE FOR. My date had a coca-cola and she did not remark on its quality.

Then things went downhill again. I overheard our waiter say that he didn‚Äôt care about our table because he had another table of 7 people. There was a 10 minute gap between finishing my second lemonade and receiving a third (would have been nice if the tablet was working).

The food was exceptional. I had the chicken tenders with ranch dressing. The chicken was perfectly crispy and had a great flavor profile that was complemented by the creamy, tangy ranch dressing. My date had chicken parmesan and again did not remark on its quality.

As we finished our meal and prepared to leave, the waiter asked us if anything was wrong and my date spoke up and said she was not happy with the service. He gave a half-hearted apology and said he would try to do better next time. Unfortunately it is unlikely that there will be a next time. He then tried to make small talk (which he had done a good job of avoiding earlier) and delayed our departure. Although the food was high quality, the dining experience was tainted by the malfunctioning tablet and poor waiting service. I paid for both of my meals and did not leave a tip.

If you are okay with spending a little money and/or are really hungry, I would say UDCC, Windows, or Conversations because of the multiple options and the fact that it is a buffet. But even then, it is hard to eat your money's worth at these locations.

For a retail location, I would say Heaping Plato and Lance and Ellie's are great choices. Each has a multitude of options but is still slightly overpriced.

If money is an issue, I would recommend bringing your own lunch/snacks for the day. I work for ISU Dining and get a free meal with most of my shifts, but other than those, I bring my own food to campus.",0,0,,p642jj,t3_p642jj,/r/iastate/comments/p642jj/fave_dining_locations_on_campus/h9cpiew/

June 10, 2020

Dear Iowa State Community,

Today I want to share with you some important decisions about the fall semester at ISU. These points represent the first broad strokes of an emerging blueprint to maintain our good health and the academic excellence of ISU, based on the work of a dozen dedicated teams working cooperatively across campus.

Here are our key decisions to date about the fall semester. We encourage anyone with questions to email [COVID-19@iastate.edu](mailto:COVID-19@iastate.edu).

**Fall classes will begin Monday, August 17.** We received approval from the Board of Regents to change our start and end dates for the fall semester. The semester will begin on Monday, August 17, a week earlier than planned. Classes will be held on Labor Day, September 7.

**Fall classes will end Wednesday, November 25.** We will end the semester, including final exams, on Wednesday, November 25, the day before Thanksgiving. This schedule provides us with the best opportunity to complete the fall semester safely and successfully on campus, while maximizing in-person instruction, maintaining experiential learning goals, and completing final exams onsite.

**Reconfiguring classrooms and delivery of courses.** This semester we will reduce the number of students in a classroom at one time. We expect students and their professors to wear face coverings. We will modify time between classes to avoid congestion in buildings, walkways, buses and other areas.

Many classes will be offered in multiple delivery options ‚Äî in-person, online or a hybrid approach ‚Äî to meet the needs of our students and instructional faculty. Our intent is for courses with labs, studio sections, capstone projects and other interactive experiences to largely be delivered through in-person instruction. We are making every effort to maximize in-person learning and the student learning experiences that are a defining characteristic of an Iowa State education.

**Testing and contact tracing.** Plans are under development for a COVID-19 testing program for students, faculty and staff. Our Thielen Student Health Center, working with other expertise on campus, will put in place enhanced contact tracing to help identify and resolve possible exposure. These efforts will be done in collaboration with our county and state public health partners.

**Face coverings, hygiene and frequent cleaning.** Although it will not be possible to mitigate every risk, every person must contribute to reducing those risks. Everyone will be strongly encouraged to show their care for our ISU community and the City of Ames by adhering to the advice, guidelines and best practices of health experts, including the Centers for Disease Control and other professional health organizations. Physical distancing and the wearing of face coverings when in class or shopping at stores, or when we‚Äôre around others will be expected. Promoting personal hygiene practices and frequent cleaning will be part of every person‚Äôs new normal as a citizen of our campus community.

**Living safely in residence halls.** The Department of Residence will offer single and double occupancy in our residence halls. Room assignments and move-in information will be sent in coming days. The move-in process will be spread out over a longer period of time to reduce congestion and allow for physical distancing. Designated spaces will be reserved in case our residence hall students need to self-isolate or quarantine during the semester.

**More information to come.** Again, these initial decisions for fall semester are not intended to answer all the questions for everyone‚Äôs specific situation. We will continue to share updates as the planning process continues through email and the [COVID-19 Fall Planning page](https://web.iastate.edu/safety/updates/covid19/planning). Let me thank the team that made it possible for us to reach this important point ‚Äî the Fall 2020 Planning Executive Committee led by Vice President for Extension and Outreach John Lawrence and our Academic Work Group led by Associate Provost Ann Marie VanDerZanden. Dr. Lawrence and Dr. VanDerZanden‚Äôs teams have been addressing an extremely complex task with input from faculty, staff and students.

**The Principles of Community**. Thirteen years ago, Iowa State formally adopted the [Principles of Community](https://www.diversity.iastate.edu/connect/principles) ‚Äî Respect, Purpose, Cooperation, Richness of Diversity, Freedom from Discrimination, and Honest and Respectful Expression of Ideas. Developed by student leaders and endorsed campus-wide, these six ideals guide us in fostering a welcoming campus climate. We expect everyone at Iowa State to practice and uphold our principles for the good of the community.

**Together, we create the ISU community¬†experience.**¬†This fall I will mark my third year as president of this amazing university. From the beginning, I have let everyone know that I want Iowa State to be known as the best land-grant university in creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for students, faculty and staff, so every person can reach their full potential. That priority¬†is not changing; it becomes even more important as we confront the depravity of racism and prejudice and mourn the tragic killing of George Floyd. I ask that you join me in rededicating ourselves to creating an ISU community of care, empathy, and positive change.

I look forward to welcoming you to Iowa State University this fall.¬†

3243,Post,"I purchased the silver dining plan assuming that the dining hall situation would not have been set up as poorly as it was this semester. I, along with about 10-15 of my friends that I know, have over 90 swipes/flex meals left over. I dont know when they expire, but I know that you can use as many flex meals in one order as you want. We are considering recruiting a large amount of homeless people and ordering 90+ meals with our flex meal and giving them out. 

It is the dumbest thing that the swipes expire each semester. Now I was well aware of this the previous years, but we purchased my plan pre-covid and didnt expect the very poor management of the dining halls to turn out how they did, so none of us went to them and ended up just going to hawthorn or somewhere to use a flex meal. We didnt find enough outlets of time to keep eating lance and ellies, hot food, etc to get rid of all of our swipes. I believe this would be a great revolt to the poor choice made by ISU Dining due to covid, and this would be within policy and could be for a very good cause.

This post is merely to gather thoughts of others that may work for ISU Dining, or have a similar experience with all these leftovers swipes which can equal up to thousands of dollars.  

tldr: covid made most students with dining plans left over with way too many swipes to lose at the end of the semester. we should use them for a bunch of meals and give them all to those in need to revolt against this poorly planned expiration of meal swipes during a global pandemic",5,97,0.95,k2zpil,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/k2zpil/using_the_stupid_isu_dining_swipes_policy_for_good/

Most student bus drivers did not have access to these specific offerings in my time, so for those who are interested - Yes, it can be a fun, rewarding job. Just make sure you understand that not everything is as straightforward as the employer may represent it to be (this is true for every job offer).

3266,Comment,"I have stayed most years, though I haven't have a meal plan and when I did live on campus I was at Towers which is far from most campus dining centers. During that time I relied on groceries and eating out, and while many of the restaurants near campus will have reduce hours they will likely be open at normal eating times. It is much quieter, but there's a lot of folk who stay (particularly if they are living in apartments).

3274,Post,"Dear Iowa State Administrators,  

This is a call to action for University leaders written on behalf of the faculty and staff at Iowa State University; today I call upon University leaders to demonstrate their commitment to employee compensation and benefits with concrete and immediate plans for increases to offset the rising costs of inflation and benefits. 

Every day, we dutifully plug away at work, enriching the lives of our students and our communities, and every year, we anxiously await news of pay increases, hoping that this will be the year we are finally rewarded for our work with a significant pay increase.  Yet year after year, we‚Äôre disappointed to find that once again, there just isn‚Äôt enough money left over at the end of the day to adjust pay for cost-of-living increases, much less reward people for performance.  It feels like the very definition of insanity, hoping for a different outcome to the same old empty promises made to faculty and staff year after year. 

University Human Resources will desperately try to convince you and potential hires that our benefits package makes up for our lack of reliable salary increases, hoping that generous time off and an affordable health plan are enough to recruit and retain talented staff. Is it enough? And more importantly, is it true? 

Over the past few years, faculty and staff have been rewarded for their hard work with annual health insurance premium increases and plan design changes that result in extra out-of-pocket costs that far exceed what little income we gained in annual increases.  University Human Resources and Administration will tell you these were necessary measures to address deficits that resulted from years of stable premiums. That‚Äôs not my problem to solve. And it shouldn‚Äôt be yours either. It‚Äôs disingenuous to admit to poor financial planning at the university level and then heap years of premium increases and plan design changes on us.  

As a member of the Employee Benefits Advisory Committee, I have fought hard for stable benefits with no plan design changes, advocating instead for monthly premium increases--because those can be anticipated and budgeted for. The HMO plan offered to Iowa State employees is truly generous and one of the best I‚Äôve seen in my years working in healthcare finance. It‚Äôs been a great tool in recruiting staff, as well as in retention. 

All of that changes effective January 1. 

That is when most faculty and staff will be faced with significant changes to their healthcare benefits.  The plan design changes are troubling for the average employee trying to anticipate their medical expenses for the year. If you are currently on the HMO plan, you benefit from virtually no out-of-pocket costs throughout the plan year‚Äîthere is an office visit copay, and preventive care isn‚Äôt free, but for the most part, you can utilize your benefits without paying for much of it. Those days of giving birth in the hospital for only a $15 copay are over‚Äîgoing forward you‚Äôll pay $3,000 of your own money. 

I am deeply concerned that Iowa State employees do not understand how much of an impact these plan changes can have on their finances.  Soon employees will begin receiving copies of explanations of benefits detailing what is owed to the medical provider and they are not going to understand; indeed, some will not be able to pay. They sure can‚Äôt count on a salary increase to help cover the difference. 

In fact, years of benefits changes coupled with insignificant salary increases mean we are all effectively making considerably less now than we were 5 years ago.  If you are on the HMO plan, you pay $29 per month for insurance; soon, you will see your premium go up 14%, or an additional $48 a year. As a matter of fact, in 2020, you didn‚Äôt pay a premium at all!  An employee with a family on the HMO plan will see their premium go up by 21%, or $492 a year.  A Professional and Scientific employee making $50,000 got an annual increase of $500 on July 1, bringing their new salary to $50,500.  If that employee has a family, though, this week‚Äôs news of premium increases and plan design changes nullifies that increase, since they will now be paying an additional $492 per year in premiums, not to mention the unknown additional costs of a deductible and coinsurance.  Congratulations, I guess, hardworking average Iowa State University employee, on your $8 a year increase.  Why, that will buy you one dozen eggs!  Don‚Äôt you feel valued? 

I don‚Äôt know about you, but I‚Äôm tired. I‚Äôm tired of being a highly educated, dedicated professional who is, year after year, rewarded for my hard work with a meager 1% across-the-board pay increase touted by Classification and Compensation as some sort of meaningful reward for my work. It‚Äôs the worst form of gaslighting, and Iowa State faculty and staff shouldn‚Äôt put up with it any longer. 

I‚Äôm tired of the University touting discretionary salary increases but not allocating additional funding for those increases.  Divisions, Units, and Departments are given parameters by University Human Resources but ultimately are allowed do what they want; most choose to dole out increases to only a small handful of employees. Indeed, there is little transparency as to how you may find your name on that short, short list of people your Vice President or Dean deem worthy of receiving more than the meager scraps the rest of us are left to fight over. 

As a former President of Professional and Scientific Council, I can tell you that I have long advocated for a university budget model that prioritizes compensation first, instead of being one of the last items budgeted. My advice, however, seems to have fallen on deaf ears. A wise man once said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I‚Äôll tell you what you value.‚Äù Iowa State University continues to demonstrate that it does not value its faculty and staff. It‚Äôs time we demand better. 

My ask is this:   


1. That the University implement an additional 2%, University-funded mandatory pay increase for all faculty and P&S staff effective January 1, 2024.  This will ensure that the average employee sees enough of a pay increase to cover additional premium costs and anticipated annual out-of-pocket expenses. 
2. That the University implement the proposed 3% performance-based increases as outlined in the September 18 memo to faculty and staff, ensuring that each Division and College is held to increasing staff pay by an average of 3%.  
3. That the University create a workgroup tasked with the development and implementation of a sustainable budget strategy that prioritizes staff compensation and increases.

I call upon University leaders to demonstrate their commitment to employee compensation and benefits with concrete and immediate plans for increases to offset the rising costs of inflation and benefits.

We'd really like to see more WiFi boosters/routers specifically for Towers (from the news we've seen, most internet projects seem to be happening on campus, which doesn't totally help us), or if the WiFi just is what it is, being able to use ethernet in our rooms for free would help significantly.",2,15,,j2py5k,t3_j2py5k,/r/iastate/comments/j2py5k/how_could_we_make_spring_semester_less_awful/g782j15/

CA's arent going to come knocking on a room where people are quitely sipping drinks.  If you're having a loud ass party that is disturbing people it's gonna make people look.  If your a drunk ass, people are gonna look.  If you're that asshole resident, people are gonna look.  Just be smart about it and you shouldn't have a problem.  Clean up your room before you leave for break, don't bother your neighbors, and what ever the fuck you do, don't smoke in the residence halls.

3336,Comment,"Let me mention that we have students who are taking the course while living in countries like India, China, or Qatar so it is unfair to schedule exams for a fairly specific time as it might cause someone to be taking an exam at 2am their local time. This is one of the reasons why we leave the exam windows open for a substantial amount of time.

As to cheating, almost any system to prevent cheating that can be used in a course of this order can be circumscribed within seconds (lock my browser? I'll just open a browser on my phone), is an unacceptable invasion of privacy (recording people taking exams), or requires a nontrivial level of technology and internet connection that we cannot expect everyone to obtain.

We also know that cheating occurs, even in face-to-face classes, we have caught people cheating before in exams with multiple proctors in the room where students were spaced apart from each other. So cheating is not a new issue to only online.

Your question is how do we prevent cheating? My answer is, while it is impossible to prevent cheating, what we can do is provide an environment which will help students feel that they do not need to cheat. We do this by making the exam open book, and open notes, we drop problems, we offer multiple exams and reduce the stakes for any assessment. The course is set up so that students who put in the effort will be able to pass without cheating. 

Let me also add that I don't feel that students are inherently prone to cheating. Most people genuinely want to learn and if we give them reasonable guidelines, I believe they will follow the guidelines.

(Students, please don't prove me wrong.)",1,25,,i6qqq0,t1_g0xtdmu,/r/iastate/comments/i6qqq0/ama_with_the_calculus_coordinator_steve_butler/g0xutrx/

If you have a tracking number and it says it's been delivered then give it a few days before shooting them an email asking. I've had a package lost there and the people I talked to helped sort out the issue really fast.

3379,Comment,"A lot of people seem to think that ISU is acting like it's making money for shareholders or something. State schools are non-profit so its not like anyone is making a profit off owning it.

I'd guess that they have to make up money in places they have control over to offset that which they dont. The Iowa Legislature took away 4.5 million dollar from ISU (and Iowa I think) because they claimed they didnt have the budget for it. Not to mention the 4.5 million was taken back after it was given to ISU, so ISU was effectively in debt to the Legislature.

Its supposedly a zero sum game.

Most professors haven't gotten inflation raises for a while or other raises afaik. Additionally there have been a lot of new hires in departments that are growing quickly like Engineering, which doesnt help the budget (even though this is departmental, but the school as a whole kind of shares money but its complicated and has to do with research money etc.)

And there are other factors fo how funding works. Money donated to the school through private donors are required to be attached to a project or service. So when the football team got a donation for new helmets (not sure if that is a thing, but just as an example), that money couldn't be used for anything other than football equipment.

A lot of contracts for restaurants also ended, like Subway and Caribou. When the contract was done ISU dining decided it was cheaper to operate their own, that's why the MU is completely different and why the Hub is being renovated.

I agree the food isnt as good as it's used to, I especially miss Convos late night bundles. I am just trying to suggest possible reasons for why its happening.

I also agree it feels like a rip, especially since he required meal plans on campus.

I'd be more angry about how much spending is ultimately mishandled by people and if that is leading to monetary issues in the school.

Sorry for the long post, this is just some of the things I have heard from professors and other people who work as ISU.

3388,Comment,"Tldr: the environment at bars suck

I'm using a throw away because my reputation will matter in my career, but here's my two cents:

When I was freshman, we couldn't drink in the bars and we didn't want to get caught in the dorms, so we'd always go to a frat and get drunk there, or we'd pregame and usually end up at the same places. Now that my group of friends is out of the dorms, most nights are spent having a small party in someone's apartment. 

The bars just aren't what we're looking for usually. The fact that their either over crowded or that there's no one there is a problem. No one wants to dance when there's only 4 other people dancing and a crowded dance floor is awful sometimes.
We do go out to the bars occasionally, but we normally go out with the mindset that the environment is going to suck and we're going to have to be really drunk to enjoy it. 

When we hang out at our apartments, we can control the environment. Loud music and dancing can happen at the same time and same place hanging out, drinking games and socializing is happening. We also know who's going to be there, so there's not going to be some douche bag throwing his drink on everyone or flailing his jacket around or starting fights etc. Some of our friends are still under 21 so it also allows us to include all of our everyone.

I don't know a lot of super nerds, but I don't know of anyone who would rather play games all night when they could be drinking and hanging out with friends. Technology probably has changed how we socialize when it comes to weekends, because it only takes one mass text to start a party with everyone showing up within a couple hours.

I get that it isn't a large dining hall, but the quality of the food isn't what it should be for a 2 year old dining hall. 

Windows has had major issues with:
-Serving raw or undercooked meat
-Incorrectly labeling food 
-Incorrectly or not listing allergens

Some other issues that are not as bad:
-Late night food is nothing but pizza and salad most of the time (problem for people with allergies) 
-Allergen free options are awful and mainly just vegan options

Compared to seasons, UDCC, and even Storms, it's sad to see a new dining center just not on par with any other dining center.

I don't think this is right. In a communist system the government distributes the products of labor so that everyone benefits (ideally), not just the workers.

> S is an interesting case because in practice I don't believe we have ever actually seen this economic model implemented.

In fairness, I don't think we've ever see any of these three systems fully implemented. Communism is probably the one we've come closest to, but the states that have tried have all mostly failed to control the ""influence"" market, leaving that open to capitalism in the form of bribery and graft. 

> C: This doesn't really flourish under any sort of government. It relies solely on supply and demand as its driving force. Any sort of government would only function to regulate this mechanic and in doing so move the economic model more towards one of the other two economic models.

Capitalism requires government intervention because not all markets are truly free. Markets are only available to people with the capital to move into them. Because of this, those with more capital have access to more opportunities to increase their capital. There is a feedback mechanism at play that pushes capitalism towards forming markets with limited or no competition (ie ""the rich get richer""). Lack of competition leads to less innovation which leads to fewer opportunities to increase capital (in the form of creating new markets). Capitalism flourishes under government that prevents excessive capital concentration while also preventing the socialization of most (maybe all, not sure) markets.

3499,Post,"**Background:**

I am an average student, my GPA isn't good at all. I was able to land an internship and it has significantly helped out in every shape, way, and form of future job searching.

**Pre-Career fair tips:**

**1a. Visit Career services** Visit your career services adviser ASAP to tune up on your resume. Your resume is obviously a big part in marketing who you are. Typos, grammar, and information not needed are huge turn offs to an employers time. Take time to research how to write a good resume, and then meet with your career services adviser. No need for fancy font, fancy paper. Remember KISS, keep it simple stupid.

**1b. Update your LinkedIn Account** Make sure it is similar to your resume, the beauty of LinkedIn is you can add as much information as you want. Remember business professional photos and content only. 

**2a. Research the companies** that will be at the career fair. Coming prepared is key. Game plan your exact movements, who you are talking too, etc. I created a spreadsheet to help keep me organized. This is an example:

Location|Company|Job Title|
:--|:--|:--|
Table 22|Reddit Co|Reddit Analyst

This minimizes your time wandering, looking like a fool. Everyone is watching you, and if you're the slow person walking around with their mouth open, it makes you look bad.

**2b. Research the company in depth.** When you see company A has Job title B you are interested, that isn't enough. Take the time to write down talking points about the company. People love talking themselves and what they represent up, so find positive things about the company. Awards, charity work, current events are great talking points. Also, at least have a general knowledge of what the company does. Don't waste the rep's time by making them explain what the company does. Your goal is to make it a short meaningful conversation, rather than a long boring conversation.

**3. Dress to impress, but not burn a hole in your wallet.** Yes, wear your nicest clothes, but no don't go out and buy fancy clothes and spend. While most men and women will be wearing business professional, you do not need a suit and tie for a career fair. Jobs have shifted from business professional to business casual in the workplace. My internship was a button down shirt with khaki/black pants. No tie, no suit, and even then I was probably over dressed. You won't land an internship/job with fancy clothes, big watches, or other accessories. Dress as nice as your current wardrobe allows you.

TLDR Pre-career fair: Research the companies, jobs, and dress to what your wardrobe allows you. Be as prepared as you can be.

**During the career fair:**

**1. Ditch your buddy.** We love being with our friends, and the career fair is not the time for that. Whether you like it or not, they are your competition. This also helps your conversations be more personable, as you don't want to tag team a conversation with a representative. It just comes off as not as interested.

**2. Ditch your elevator speech.** The classic elevator speech is a boring, time wasting trap. Rep's are there all day hearing elevator speeches and yours probably isn't meaningful enough to stick out. Instead, work your elevator speech around your conversation. For example, here is how I would start a conversation:

>I_am_bot: ""Good afternoon (shakes hand). I'm [Insert name] and saw that [their company] is here and I was interested in [position listed]. Do you have any information on [position listed]?

This can obviously be altered, but it's a way better start than you reading your memorized boring elevator speech. I'm 15 seconds in and already talking about the position(s). The conversation ALWAYS leads to the meat of you elevator speech, as you can explain your interest level, class year, graduation date, major, etc. I received this tip from a club leader at the COB breakfast. I asked him what's one mistake candidates always make during the career fair, and he told me the elevator speech and to ditch it.

**3. Body Position.** This is pretty simple. Eye contact always, firm handshake, stand up straight, listen and speak when you can (don't interrupt!), nod your head when being given information, it's a ""I understand"" response without physically speaking it. Don't fiddle with your hair, keep your hands still, do a vampire cough/sneeze. You are being analyzed more than just what your resume says, and how you use your body are indicators to people.

**4. Take Merchandise** Companies bring a butt load of stuff. Pens, cups, USB sticks, bags, etc. Take it! They want it out of their hands. This shows you have interest in their brand. Be polite when you do, you can ask if you can take an item. They'll almost always reply happily saying ""TAKE ANYTHING YOU WANT.""

**5. Have plenty of resumes available** Even though most companies will tell you to apply online, or that they don't take resumes, always have enough to give at least 1 per company you intend to talk to. If you have a business card that works as well, but resumes work just as well.

**6. Ask for contact information outside of the career fair** LinkedIn and business cards are the 2 best ways to connect with your representative after the career fair. Always ask if they have a business card, and ask if we can connect on LinkedIn. LinkedIn is the future of job connections

**7. Fake it to make it** As mentioned before, the career fair is a pre-interview interview. A lot of company rep's judge the candidate by if they were someone they would want to work with. Be bubbly, personable, and chatty. People, as mentioned before, love talking about themselves, and the more you can get a rep to talk about themselves and the company, the better. This is a way to market yourself, and if you're shy you won't look good. Step outside your comfort zone for 2-3 hours. 

Anymore questions I would be happy to give answers, and if I think of anymore tips, I'll add them",10,68,0.95,anuqkp,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/anuqkp/with_career_fair_week_starting_here_are_some_tips/

3522,Post,"TLDR: The Board of Regents changed the time of today's Public Comments Session once they found out my friends and I wanted to speak. They left early and ignored our voices.  

The State of Iowa Board of Regents (BoR) is the administrative body that makes big decisions about how Iowa State University and other Iowa schools spend and get their money. Today, the Board of Regents was on campus and held an all day meeting in the ISU Alumni Center. 

During this meeting, there was a section of the meeting where 30 minutes were dedicated to a Public Comments Session. A group of my friends and I are very concerned about one of the recent actions the BoR took. We planned to show up and make our case to the BoR. We had around 25 to 30 students, alumni, and community leaders gathered to speak our minds about the issue and push the BoR to change their plans. 

We were told that the session would start at 4:30pm. We showed up at around 3:45pm, checked in with the people at the door, and waited patiently outside for the session to begin. At 4:30 when we asked again, the people at the door told us that the session time had been moved up, already taken place, and ended. 

By 4:30pm, the BoR had already ended the rest of today's meeting and left.  Their publicly posted meeting minutes said they were supposed to go all the way till 5:20pm, with the Public Comments Session from 4:30 to 5:00. No where was this time change publicly available  and the people already gathered to participate were not informed. 

Regardless if you agree with our group's issues about the budget or not, I hope you can agree with me that this behavior is unacceptable and wrong. These are the people who your tuition money goes to. These are the people who are supposed to be our leaders. They are acting like frightened children and I will not stand for it. 

If you would like to ensure that students have a voice at this university, please comment or DM me and I can make my pitch to you about joining the group that didn't get to speak today. Thank you for reading my rant, have a silenced rest of your day.",44,185,0.89,pp2955,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/pp2955/the_voices_of_students_were_silenced_today_by_the/

3526,Comment,"Use your swipes to their full potential. If you are using a full flex meal to pay for $7 worth of stuff, you are losing money.

Dining halls I think cost 15 dollars per swipe if you pay using meal swipes. A meal plan will save you money if you use primarily swipes and use all or most of them. You are getting 2.50-3.00 off every meal ish by using swipes. I used to get a meal and a half out of a single swipe by showing up, eating, doing homework for a bit, then eating again.

If you are getting meals with pay by item flex meals or something, you are maybe losing money. I forget how much flex meals come out to, but at least last year it was $11 or something like that, and not worth it. I don't know if they have updated it or not.

Basically, if you can sit down at Seasons/UDCC/Convos if it is back to sit down (is it back to sit down?) then it is worth it compared to paying on credit card, but if you eat primarily using flex meals/dining dollars at Hawthorn/Clyde's/etc. then it might not be worth it.",0,2,,15ye3li,t3_15ye3li,/r/iastate/comments/15ye3li/are_meal_plans_more_expensive_than_just_going/jxdiwxa/

3536,Post,"My partner Courtney and I want to take you and our fellow Americans out for breakfast for part of a book we're writing: 'Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America'. We've posted around prior to starting our trip and now we are currently on the road and will be in the state for two days. We'll likely be in the Des Moines area but we are willing to travel a bit out of the way for an interesting story (millitary, nurse, farmer, etc). 

Do you fit the description? If yes, email us. If not, please pass the word along. Please see our site or Facebook page for more info:

* [Breakfast with Strangers site](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com)
* [BWS Facebook page](http://facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers)  

If you are interested - please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA. Please include 'IOWA' in the subject line. 

**More details about our project**

On July 18, 2012 we hit the road from Portland, OR bound for Portland, ME (and back) and all places in between. Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, we‚Äôll blend old-fashioned and contemporary connection as we seek out strangers in a variety of ways: bulletin boards, classifieds, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, CouchSurfing, pure chance, and more. We‚Äôll build community and engage local media outlets along the way.

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this‚Äîor at least challenge it in our own small way‚Äîby taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We‚Äôll share local diner fare and conversation, learning what our new friends think about life‚Äôs big and little questions. We‚Äôll chronicle these conversations in our blog so that strangers can meet strangers‚Äîvirtually. Our project will foster connection, conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we‚Äôll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book, Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. We will donate 10 percent of the book‚Äôs proceeds to Servas US, a non-profit organization promoting peace through travel and relationship-building.

3548,Comment,"""*for the low grades you gotten, did you retake them""* 

Yes, I did. It was absolutely necessary for me. My GPA had fallen below a 2.0, which meant I lost my scholarships. To get them back, I NEEDED to raise my GPA, otherwise I was going to have to drop out. When I finished my spring semester of freshman year, I had a 1.4 GPA. I'd got Ds in com s 227 as well in physics 221, and I got an F in calc 2. The semester before that, I finished with mostly Cs and C-s. That summer, I retook Calc 2 and took econ 101 online as well. I got a C+ in Calc 2 and an A in econ. This bumped my GPA up from a 1.4 to a 1.97. During the fall semester, I retook physics and com s 227. I got a B- and an A- respectively. Also took english 250 and got an A. Retaking calc/physics/cs227 helped A LOT. My gpa went from a 1.97 to a 2.73. (During that semester, I not only regained the scholarships I had previously lost, but I gained another huge scholarship that took a huge load off of my family's shoulders. I'm very grateful.) I never expected such a huge change, but again, retaking those classes I had failed and replacing the grades made a tremendous difference. After that, my GPA kept climbing, but it was much more gradual. At the start of last semester, I was at a 2.85, and at the start of this one/currently I'm sitting at a 3.05. Still waiting to see where it ends up after this semester though. 

&#x200B;

 *Or just let them stay in order to not extend your graduation..* 

I'm a semester behind now and while that does suck, I feel much better knowing that I went back and learned the basics (cs 227). I didn't have a choice, I needed a C- at least to advance to other classes, but I know I would have failed even worse if I had advanced without learning how to do well in school.

&#x200B;

 *how diid you manage to uplift your gpa..* 

As for how I managed to raise it, it took a lot of work. I'm not going to lie and say it was easy. I had to get really, really dedicated to my school work. I started going to professors' office hours, I did my homework as soon as it was assigned so that I rarely procrastinated, and I made strict study schedules for myself. A lot of people think this sounds miserable, but honestly, going into an exam and KNOWING you're going to do well has got to be one of the best feelings in the world. Getting your grade back and seeing that you got an A is super satisfying and really rewarding. It's hard work, but nothing worth having comes easy. It's all about your mindset, really. You have to ask yourself how badly do you want it and then try new habits that will help make you a better student (e.g, waking up early, bullet journaling, tutoring, etc.) 

&#x200B;

Failing as badly as I did freshman year was a wake up call for me. Life slapped me in the face and honestly, I'm really grateful for that experience. My life is completely different now and I'm a completely different person, not to mention much happier, too. :) Hope this answers your questions!",0,1,,bmo8po,t1_emyyvta,/r/iastate/comments/bmo8po/a_super_uplifting_and_inspirational_story_for/en5q35c/

3600,Comment,"In towers a meal plan isn't required, but I'd say you should go with one of two options, especially as a freshman.

1) Just go for Silver. Gold normally has too much meals and it's necessarily worth it, and limits your flex meals (separate meals based on quick purchases at places like C-Stores). Silver was a little more than enough for me, but depending on how much meals you eat, it may vary. You'll also get dining dollars so you have extra money to spend to get something to drink during the day at a campus based store.

2) Block meals. I normally recommend this to anyone living in one of the towers who is NOT a freshman. At this point you'd already know your options, but as a freshman, sometimes you don't so it's good to stir away from this. The only reason you'd go for this is it's a little cheaper.

As for how flex meals work. We have these places called C-Stores. You have a location between Wallace and Wilson called South Side Market. There's also East and West Side, along with the other markets and cafes. When you go to one of these locations you CANNOT use normal meals, but you can use debit cards, cash, flex meals, and dining dollars. Flex meals ONLY WORK ON SPECIFIC ITEMS and most stores tell you which ones. I work at one of the C-Stores, and for flex meals we allow fountain drinks, anything in the labeled cooler (has yogurts, small milks, cheese sticks), Entrees (Hot Dogs and Sandwiches), Bakery items, a couple of the ice creams and a small amount of other things. You CAN use flex meals on these options, but if you would like to, you can always opt to use dining dollars instead.

If you have any other questions regarding meal plans and such, I'm pretty good with them since I've worked in ISU Dining for the past couple years, so let me know!",0,1,,gwsfm0,t3_gwsfm0,/r/iastate/comments/gwsfm0/meal_plan_advice_for_someone_living_in_towers/ftj9zx6/

Downtown is a far walk if you aren't used to hills. It would take you ~45 minutes at a brisk pace to get from your hotel to downtown (I've done the walk before). The drunk bus used to be operated by the university, but I think the local bus (Mountain Lion) has taken over most of if not all of it. Towers which is where it picks up and drops off is about a 10 minute walk from your hotel.

3648,Comment,"I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you‚Äôre referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I‚Äôve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called ‚ÄúLinux‚Äù, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.
Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine‚Äôs resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux.

3655,Comment,"Comedy definitely helps to ease pain.  Sometimes when you are hurting, laughter is the best medicine.

I think most of my comedy comes from various wordplays we did in my family as I was growing up, we really loved the twisting of meaning of words and that can have fun effect.  The other part comes from my over-consumption of media.  I watch a lot of TV and do a lot of reddit.  The good news is that occasionally I can find jokes which are great by throwing in pop culture references (so in a recent lecture I made a Rick and Morty reference which people liked); occasionally this has made me say something unintentionally embarrassing (but the students still loved it).

As to my tests being ""sadistically"" hard, I got to work on that.  The thing is that I get so excited about problems and I want to share them with people, and tests are a great way to do it.  And some classes I only get to teach once every couple of years so I have a lot of stored problems to share.

The other thing is that I firmly believe you will more about how much you know if you take a hard test.  If you only take easy tests and you do well, then did you well because you were smart or did you do well because the test was easy.  Only when you are put in a stressed situation will you be able to find out how much you know.

We know this can be hard on the students, which is why we also strive to make sure there is communication about how people are faring and whether they are doing well.  Recently I have been using emojis to indicate how people should feel about their test (the happy, meh, and frowny emojis; and no not the ""chocolate pudding"" emoji).

On a side note I did once write an easy test, and everyone did well.  That was the worst feeling ever for me.  I did not give my students a chance to find out how much they knew.  I swore to myself then that I would never write an easy test again.  So far I have been pretty good about keeping that promise.",0,21,,71yh62,t1_dnecqlk,/r/iastate/comments/71yh62/i_am_a_steve_butler_ask_me_anything/dnedgy5/

-Big campus in a small town, meaning it feels like the whole town is just an extension of the university. This brings a very cool energy to town on things like game day, or homecoming week, etc.

-Diverse student population, the scope of ISU‚Äôs student population means that it won‚Äôt feel like a ‚Äòconservative‚Äô or ‚Äòliberal‚Äô or any one kind of campus. Instead, ISU allows you to really engage in any way of your choosing

-Great resources on campus, I‚Äôve been amazed at the ability to find help for any class that I‚Äôve struggled with here on campus. It seems that the student population is very invested in helping one another which adds to the community. 

-Great bar scene for older students, I know that doesn‚Äôt matter much now, but it is a nice thing to look forward to

As a former CA though, what were you permitted to do if, say, you saw beer cans from the doorway? I've had CAs that just sort of walk in when they see something after someone opens the door, but I was talking to a friend last night who said he was busted once but the CA stayed in the hall, stating that he wasn't allowed in the room.

They used to let us have as much orange chicken as we wanted, now it's rice bowls that come with 3 pieces of meat. The food station in the middle used to grill flank steak and other different types of meat, now it's just mushy vegetables that have been sitting out all day. I have no doubt that this has all been done as a way to cut costs and it infuriates me because the food they serve has nowhere near the value of the $10 meal swipe I pay with.

To your current questions, in most years A/C is only need for a couple of weeks.  A night a fan pulling in outside air is a big help and on hot days spending the heat of the day in an air conditioned space like the Library or Union or dining center is good.

It is a little inconvenient not to have a dining center attached to your dorm, but as others have mentioned, the bus system in Ames is one of the best in the country and in this case will take your daughter pretty much door-to-door from the towers to UDCC & Windows.

3742,Post,"I just finished moving in and completed the COVID testing, so I figured I would share what the process was like for me. Thankfully there weren‚Äôt many people there when I was, so my process may differ from people moving in later. Apologies in advance if there are any spelling/grammar errors in this, as I‚Äôm writing this up on my phone while waiting for food. 

When I arrived at Leid Rec center, I was greeted by some kind workers who told me to get my ID and Confirmation email ready. After entering the building, your temperature will get checked (mine was fine, so I don‚Äôt know what happens if you have a fever), then you will go and scan your ID and give your phone number for the testing kit label. I got super lucky and was able to check in with Wendy.

After finishing all the check-in process, you get taken to a hallway where a bunch of stations set up to get tested. The process was pretty quick; they stick the testing swab up your nose and spin it a few times - don‚Äôt know the exact number of rotations they do. It wasn‚Äôt painful but it felt like I was going sneeze and made my eyes watery. 

After having the test completed, you drop off the testing kit in a bin, then go and get your keys down the hall. When getting the keys to the room, they provided a temp parking pass for moving in, then they listed were to park until the parking passes get handed out. This was the last step to do before going through the exit path, which ISU Dining was set up giving out water bottles, cookies, or an apple. 

The entire process was pretty simple to get through, and there were plenty of people who knew what they were doing to make this process go smoothly.",35,173,0.99,i1de58,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/i1de58/i_just_completed_move_in_and_covid_testing/

3758,Post,"Today is COVID New Year's Day at ISU.

About eight or nine months ago, we started tracking how many days deep we were into COVID.  I've since forgotten what prompted that particular masochism, but I went back to my calendar.  January 27, 2020 was the day a bunch of us from DPS, Thielen, Risk Management, and Emergency Management first met to discuss coordination for ISU's response to what was then ""2019-nCoV.""  I retroactively designated that as ISU's COVID Day 1 and it stuck.

On February 14, my boss retired.  I inherited her position and ISU's emergency management program.  Her timing was impeccable.

February 28 was COVID Day 33.  That afternoon, the incident management team met to plan our next steps for a large-scale repatriation of students if a country went critical on the WHO or CDC pandemic risk assessments.  We went home that evening feeling like we'd done good work.  A few hours later, we were back on campus to implement that plan because the CDC had just issued a Level 3 alert for Italy and we had over 140 students who needed to come home right then.

March 11 was COVID Day 45.  That was the Wednesday before Spring Break, and the day we announced that we were going to 100% online instruction for two weeks.

Two weeks.  Heh.

On March 12, I walked down to the MU for lunch.  On the way back, I passed a knot of seniors on the front steps of Curtiss.  They were saying their goodbyes - to each other, and to campus.  ""This isn't how I wanted my senior year to end,"" I heard one say.

Yeah.  We didn't want to end it that way either.

On March 21, COVID Day 55, Story County had its first detected case of COVID-19.

March 25 brought Story County's second case and the official determination of community transmission.

April 29 was COVID Day 94.  Story County recorded its first COVID-19-related death.

On COVID Day 100, President Wintersteen sent Cyclone Strong t-shirts to the four of us who'd become ISU's Emergency Operations Center leadership team.  At the time, it seemed like a fairly long incident.

And after that: Summer and the massive effort of ""bringing employees back to campus"" (conveniently ignoring the fact that a bunch of us never left).  Figuring out how the hell we were going to make the fall semester work.  Move-in and mass testing.  A derecho *in the middle of move-in and mass testing*.  The fallout and fear from 801 Day...

I didn't want to let today pass without acknowledgement, but when I tried to put together a more comprehensive timeline of COVID-19 at ISU, it was staggering.  And depressing.  NGL, March through about May was a dark time.  Reading through emails and threads from those months really brought that back for me.

Last spring, a lot of people were saying, ""the pandemic is going to be a marathon, not a sprint.""  Sometime in the summer, I started responding with, ""no, it's a lifestyle.""

And it's one we're all tired of.

We're tired of masks.  We're tired of social distancing.  We're tired of isolation.  We're tired of nasal swabs and Zoom and 10-people-or-less gatherings and carryout-only restaurants and being simultaneously told we're going too far and we're not doing enough and walking through a sterile and empty campus.  We're tired of ""normal"" being something we remember rather than something we live.

It's not over today.  Tomorrow isn't looking good, either.  But it will end.  I won't say ""we'll get back to normal"" because ""normal"" changes after every disaster, but we will figure out what ""normal"" means after COVID.

And ""after COVID"" is coming.  I can't give you a date.  We're out on the far end of a very long vaccine supply chain with a lot of variables and uncertainties upstream from us.  But it's happening.  Every week, we get a few more needles in a few more arms.  It's slow.  It'll most likely continue to be slow for a while.  But **we will get there**.

Hang in there.  Watch out for each other.  And maybe thank a custodian or a Health Services employee.  They could stand to hear it.

3762,Comment,"Hmmm.  One change.  Well I think the biggest issue we have right now is that teaching is not highly valued by our administration.  Don't get me wrong you will find statements where they *say* that quality teaching is a top priority and that they always want good teachers, but their actions are quite different in that they accept **adequate** teaching and put **way more** emphasis on research when it comes to promotion and recognition (i.e., salary).

So what I would change is to give the faculty more incentive to do good teaching, promote and reward great teachers.  When I look around the math department I see some amazing faculty who could do great work with the students, but they choose not to because it is against their own career interests.  (This is the right choice for them.)

By the end of 2008, there were half a dozen of us that had been there for several years and we pretty much ran the Solution Center as far as process and all new employees. Everyone was responsible for a certain aspect of SolCtr, from scheduling hours, managing employees, training, we compartmentalized all on our own. We had no authority outside of our office and full time employees were the bosses, but we knew just as much as they did and if something didn't work, we were the ones that fixed it. But we all graduated at the same time, and it left a huge skillset vacuum. From what I hear, they never recovered.

Part of that was because at the same time, a guy named Don was brought over from ASB to Durham to implement a new process, called KCS. I don't remember what the acronym was short for, but it was to eliminate actual knowledge in employee minds. All ""knowledge"" was to be documented in the ticket system and wiki, and employees were expected to follow the script, put people on hold, research the documentation, and provide them with the solution we already had. The emphasis moved from skilled troubleshooters to dumb congeniality. But there was no plan for accumulating new knowledge. If everyone is dumb but nice, how will they solve new problems? That was another huge factor.

In my time, the SolCtr went from about 20 employees to almost 100. Hours of operation went from 8-5 to 6-6 to 6-10 to 6-midnight, weekends got added, etc. They staffed for hours that no one was calling in. They employed people that were not qualified or did not want to be there. They pushed an ideology of reading existing information without being able to solve problem. This was all before a new CIO, but it looks like the seeds of mismanagement were planted much longer than most would think. If you are a student and want a job in IT, don't go to the SolCtr, look at a college dept.",0,12,,4tgqnp,t3_4tgqnp,/r/iastate/comments/4tgqnp/its_a_series_of_bad_decisions/d5h8xhx/

As I was just walking past and didn't want to be exposed or in their way I didn't get a great look, but these are the same people who I have seen in the vans outside of Convos that seem to be helping with some of the quarantine stuff. 

Will there be some sort of formal announcement informing us that someone has testing positive so we can self quarantine if we had close contact to them? If not, what procedures will be taken to inform people who may have been exposed to them?

But ordering Jimmy Johns, Pizza Pit, Jeff's Pizza, Chinese, Fighting Burrito, or any other delivery place plus going to any restaurant or ever being in town will not happen a collective 3-4 times a week and is too difficult for freshmen?

I don't buy that. 

Not to mention there are tons and tons of clubs that give out free food and pizza to get people to attend. You could probably eat for free 5 days a week if you really tried with the weekly club meetings.

I guess that the campus empties out and it is pretty lonely and bleak during the winter break. For folks who do stay back, how do you get to dining halls in the snow, if at all they stay open. If not, do we just have to grab a bite at Convos? where else can we get a bite on campus? Do we just use our dining dollars?

Also, what do you do to stay sane when the campus empties out? Not that the campus is hopping currently.

Introduction

Iowa State University is a world-class institution, known for its excellent academic programs, vibrant campus community, and beautiful campus. However, one area where ISU could improve is in the availability of dining options for students. Currently, the campus dining centers are located in various buildings, making it difficult for students to access them quickly and easily.

To address this issue, we propose the addition of a new dining center on top of the Campanile, called the Camp-a-Meal. The Campanile is a well-known and iconic landmark on the ISU campus, and its central location would make it an ideal location for a dining center. The Camp-a-Meal would provide students with a convenient, unique, and appealing dining option, while also enhancing the use and visibility of the Campanile.

Background

The Campanile is a 277-foot tall bell tower that is located in the heart of the ISU campus. Built in 1912, the Campanile is one of the oldest and most recognized buildings on campus. It currently serves as a carillon and is open to the public for tours.

The Campanile has a spacious observation deck on its top level, offering panoramic views of the campus and surrounding area. However, this space is currently underutilized, with only a few benches and a small museum exhibit.

Adding the Camp-a-Meal dining center to the top of the Campanile would provide a unique and appealing dining option for students, while also enhancing the use and visibility of the Campanile. The Camp-a-Meal would offer a variety of food options, including healthy and sustainable options, to cater to the diverse tastes of ISU students.",8,38,0.96,zjc8yf,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/zjc8yf/asked_chatgpt_to_write_a_proposal_for_the/

Just wanted to let both new students, returnees, and any other Cyclone fans know about /r/cyclONEnation. It's a subreddit dedicated to anything and everything Iowa State sports.

About two months ago a new team of us mods took over, and started trying to revamp and grow it into a good source of information and discussion. We recently had an [AMA with Bobby La Gesse](http://www.reddit.com/r/cyclONEnation/comments/2d965w/ama_hi_im_bobby_la_gesse_ask_me_anything_about/), sports writer for the Ames Tribune, and we are trying to get more lined up.

With the new football season revving up next week, and all the other sports getting started as well, we'd love for everyone to come join us.

3886,Comment,"I'm sure people will think I'm dumb, but I personally did a meal plan the one year I lived in an apartment off campus (I did 3 years in dorms, and 1 year off campus) and it was great for me. I got the meal plan with the least amount of meals on it. Somedays I would make lunch and bring it on campus, but I spent so much time on campus in research labs or the library, I liked being able to just walk to the MU for a meal.

Another thing to think about, are you a person normally on campus pretty late? My junior and senior year I basically lived at the lib because my ADHD made it nearly impossible for me to get any work done at home. It was a very regular thing for me to be at the lib until 10pm (but normally later like midnight) at least 4-5 nights a week. The last thing I wanted to worry about when I got home late was packing a lunch for the next day. So, the meal plan made sense for me.

Just relax and be yourself.  The career fair, while an important event to attend every semester, isn't the only way to line up summer internships or full-time jobs after college.

3956,Comment,"I just graduated this December. My freshman year was 2019-2020. I started in the dorms and my first semester was fairly normal. I made some friends on my dorm floor and realized I hated my major and ended up switching half way through the semester. I hated my roommate and she moved out at semester and a friend moved in which was cool, but then we went to spring break and never came back. I stayed with my bf at his parents house because my parents are a lot older/immune compromised. That was actually so chill. I was in the design core and in the drawing class. I just chilled in my bf‚Äôs basement and spent basically all my time drawing which was lowkey therapeutic for me. 

Fall 2020 My bf and I moved into an apartment with the friend who was my second dorm roommate and two of her friends. Unfortunately they turned out to be shitty friends and would talk shit behind my back. I had all my classes online so lowkey I should‚Äôve just stayed at my bf‚Äôs/my parents‚Äô house and done school online. My bf and I moved in with my sister and her bf at semester. The two month long winter break was so sick honestly. It was such a chill time to move. I did get COVID for the first time the week of thanksgiving that year so my bf‚Äôs sisters brought us leftover thanksgiving food and left it on our porch which was sweet. Spring semester 2021 I had a couple hybrid classes which felt a little weird to go back to pre-vaccine imo. 

Fall 2021 was pretty much back to normal. I was in my design program and everything was in-person and very hands-on. I was living in ankeny with my bf and sister and her bf so I was driving back and forth everyday which was a little annoying. If I could do it again I would definitely live closer to campus. Being so far away made it hard to hang out with people and spend time with friends. January 2022 I got COVID again right before classes started and I missed the first week. Other than that the semester was chill but I was still driving back and forth from ankeny which was annoying. 

Fall 2022 my bf and I moved to the apartment we‚Äôre still at in Ames. We live kinda far from campus but was closer than ankeny lol and we wanted to live in a chill apartment without a bunch of loud neighbors and parties all the time which definitely worked out. Fall 2022/spring 2023 were chill and I started to actually really hang out with friends outside of class for the first time. 

Fall 2023 was my last semester and was kind of intense. I would not recommend taking 18 credits your last semester if you‚Äôre in a design major where you have to focus on a senior project. But hey I graduated and that‚Äôs all that matters. 

I feel like overall my college experience wasn‚Äôt super typical due to COVID affecting such a large part of it, especially in the beginning. I didn‚Äôt get to really solidify friendships early on. I do have good friends now, but I do wish I was able to get closer to them earlier. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve had my boyfriend this whole time because without him I would have been so incredibly lonely. I was still kind of lonely in a friend way for a while which sucks but it is what it is. I learned to be comfortable with myself and independent which is a good thing. Sometimes I wish I had a more ‚Äútypical‚Äù experience but other times I‚Äôm grateful for the unique experience I had and what I gained from it.",0,9,,18vnz68,t3_18vnz68,/r/iastate/comments/18vnz68/covid_memories/kfss1b8/

It's actually even worse than what I stated - for people under 40, the all-cause mortality rate is less than 0.2%. For college age, it's closer to 0.1%.

4013,Post,"Over the past 2 years of living in the Res halls, I have had nothing but bad experiences at Windows.

I get that it isn't a large dining hall, but the quality of the food isn't what it should be for a 2 year old dining hall. 

Windows has had major issues with:
-Serving raw or undercooked meat
-Incorrectly labeling food 
-Incorrectly or not listing allergens

Some other issues that are not as bad:
-Late night food is nothing but pizza and salad most of the time (problem for people with allergies) 
-Allergen free options are awful and mainly just vegan options

Compared to seasons, UDCC, and even Storms, it's sad to see a new dining center just not on par with any other dining center.

I will require CyRide to play Vengabus ""We like to Party!"" and it will keep getting progressively louder until people move to the back of the bus to make room for onboarding students.

I will push student Government to erect a statue of Steve Butler. Steve Butler is the heart and soul of the ISU math department and his dedication to all of the calculus student has helped students get through their tougher classes. We can not thank Steve enough, a statue in front of Carver would be the least to thank him.

The computers on the 2nd floor of Hoover hall have been removed since Covid. I would like to bring the computers back to hoover and other computer labs on campus.

There need to be emphasis on better logistics and financial planning at ISU dining. The rest of the finances going to remodeling the dining centers should  be diverted to the current understaffing issue and raising ISU dining wages.

There is a lot of resources on campus that undergraduates have not made use of, the university needs to do a better job of advertising programs such as SI, Make to innovate, and research opportunities.

The Okta Verification has been a pain and a half for students to deal with.  I would love to have the ability for the university to distribute Yubi keys through the library rental system to students.

Also Minecraft Monday's need to be a thing.

4031,Post,"\    As of 2020, each student living in the dorms (with the exception of towers), will be pay any of the following... (DD - Dining Dollars)
 
Meal Plan|$/Sem.|$/Ac. Yr|DD/Yr|
:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|**Cardinal**|2183|4386|100|
|**Cyclone**|2931|4782|600|
|**Gold**|2051|4102|400|
|**CyFlex**|2391|4782|150

\    With each plan ranging from 100 to 600 dollars per year. You are forced to spend each penny by the end of the year or you will lose this balance at the end of each academic year. Currently, students are able to obtain DD and/or Cycash (CC) Though CC is voluntary, they do not expire after each academic year. They only expire if your account has not activity for a full calendar year. In addition, CC can be used at any location on campus just like DD. Both DD & CC are re-loadable.

In all, since CyCash is more friendlier to students, just as versatile on campus, and do not expire like DD do. Dining dollars should be abolished and should be switched over to CyCash.\

Presentation: I was pleasantly surprised when I saw my spread of wonderful Thanksgiving classics. Turkey - decent portion size, lean and carved right in front of you at Wood Grill. Carrots - seasoned well but lacking some major roasting. Yukon mashed potatoes - basic. Gravy - wasn‚Äôt very promising. Cranberry Relish - cute little portion size, typical. Pumpkin pie - perfect amount of whipped cream, looked great! Cornbread ‚Äùdressing‚Äú - It‚Äòs called stuffing but ok...looked unreasonably moist. Powermilk - ok I‚Äòm just messing around. 

Flavor & Texture: This is obviously the most important category. I was both satisfied and disappointed. Let‚Äôs start with some sides. Cranberry Relish - good flavor but you know it comes from a can. Carrots - disappointing, very soft and sweet yet cold and flavorless. Cornbread dressing - So good. I actually really enjoyed the classic stuffing flavor and texture was just right! Now for the bulk of the meal...Yukon mashed potatoes - quite natural taste, barely any seasoning but that‚Äôs what gravy is for. Gravy - tasteful, warm, scrumptious. Turkey - lean and tasty, quite dry but then again gravy. Pumpkin pie - delicious, and accompanied my meal perfectly. 

I can honestly say I was fulfilled with this meal. It really shocked me how well Seasons and presumably the other dining halls did with this. As I walked past the overflowing dish line, praying for my poor coworkers, I reflected on my meal and smiled a little with a sense of nostalgia and happiness that I got to have a somewhat normal Thanksgiving.

4061,Post,"Here's a starter list

‚Ä¢ Downtown Ames for cute local businesses, restaurants, the farmers market, well established bars, public art, Octagon Arts Center, and even the really nice library

‚Ä¢ Campustown for student centered nightlife, dive bars, local businesses and restaurants. Clouds is an awesome coffee shop on the top level of Legacy Tower with great views of campus

‚Ä¢ Somerset for a nice place to walk. It was intended to be another downtown environment, but most businesses are just financial services or clinics. However, The Cafe, Wallaby's, Brick Town, and El Azteca are all successful local restaurants worth visiting

‚Ä¢ Campus is a great place to walk, see interesting architecture, find lots of public art funded by the Iowa Public Art For Public Buildings initiative, go to 3 great museums,, watch wildlife at Lake Laverne, go to live music events at the Memorial Union, go to college sports events, and enjoy the beauty of the four seasons, especially in April and October 

‚Ä¢ Reiman Gardens for the indoor tropical butterfly enclosure, conservatory- especially during winter, the wonderful 12 or so different gardens with noticeable changes throughout the year, awesome events for Christmas and Halloween, and excellent rotating sculpture displays 

‚Ä¢ Throughout town is a great bike trail system, part of the central Iowa trails. The trails connect most parts of the town and its parks system, which is also worth visiting for places like Ada Hayden Lake, Tedesco Environmental Learning Corridor, Moore Memorial Park, North River Valley Park at the whitewater rapids, and Inis Grove Park 

‚Ä¢ Story County has lots of hiking trails, especially along the Skunk River Greenbelt. McFarland Park is quite nice, even found a natural 4' waterfall there. Most are managed by Story County Conservation, but even in Ames, public land for hiking can be found at Pammel Woods, Munn Woods, and Reactor Woods. Please treat these areas well if you go

‚Ä¢ Lockwood Cafe and Reliable St are totally a hidden gem, with tons of artwork and cool graffiti on all sides of the building inside and out, an indoor skate ramp upstairs at WeCycle, great events like open mic night, outdoor movie showings, and they even had a passenger rail event to Boone. The surrounding grounds also have a small children‚Äôs garden, really unique wooden play feature designed by architecture students, free community garden on a first come first serve basis, and free thrift store",10,75,1.0,1b5g6q6,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/1b5g6q6/things_to_do_and_hidden_gems_in_ames/

4070,Comment,"Thanks for that update.

Yes, there have been small changes. The college of vet-med just had success in implementing levels to the Vet-tech merit class and raised their wage.

Unfortunately, it seems unless there is a willingness from the directors of the employing unit to push for increases, there is no real movement on wage increases. 

This means ISU will always be behind on raising wages and will not do so unless forced, not take a lead in raising wages",1,1,,vhdvtx,t1_ijmd0cy,/r/iastate/comments/vhdvtx/any_news_about_isu_dinings_wage/ijmhp0s/

I'm not really looking to be as independent as what Frederiksen Ct. offers due to it being my first year, and I'm trying to get out there as much as I can and be social.  It is also extremely far from my classes.

I contacted the housing office and they said really the only way to change my assignment is to find someone from a hall that's willing to exchange assignments with me.

4102,Post,"I was skeptical at first yet it exceeded my expectations. Shoutout all the homies at Seasons who worked their asses off. 

Presentation: I was pleasantly surprised when I saw my spread of wonderful Thanksgiving classics. Turkey - decent portion size, lean and carved right in front of you at Wood Grill. Carrots - seasoned well but lacking some major roasting. Yukon mashed potatoes - basic. Gravy - wasn‚Äôt very promising. Cranberry Relish - cute little portion size, typical. Pumpkin pie - perfect amount of whipped cream, looked great! Cornbread ‚Äùdressing‚Äú - It‚Äòs called stuffing but ok...looked unreasonably moist. Powermilk - ok I‚Äòm just messing around. 

Flavor & Texture: This is obviously the most important category. I was both satisfied and disappointed. Let‚Äôs start with some sides. Cranberry Relish - good flavor but you know it comes from a can. Carrots - disappointing, very soft and sweet yet cold and flavorless. Cornbread dressing - So good. I actually really enjoyed the classic stuffing flavor and texture was just right! Now for the bulk of the meal...Yukon mashed potatoes - quite natural taste, barely any seasoning but that‚Äôs what gravy is for. Gravy - tasteful, warm, scrumptious. Turkey - lean and tasty, quite dry but then again gravy. Pumpkin pie - delicious, and accompanied my meal perfectly. 

I can honestly say I was fulfilled with this meal. It really shocked me how well Seasons and presumably the other dining halls did with this. As I walked past the overflowing dish line, praying for my poor coworkers, I reflected on my meal and smiled a little with a sense of nostalgia and happiness that I got to have a somewhat normal Thanksgiving.

4155,Comment,"I agree with this, but just to add, it legitimately makes no sense to purchase meals/meal plans over dining dollars unless you go to the dining centers 2 times for lunch and dinner daily, even if you use up a swipe. It will be more expensive because of the stupid way the plans are priced. A breakdown:


Silver cost: 1875

Silver DD: 300

Silver Meals: 150*(10.50 (cost of breakfast at dining center, and amount of DD available if you use flex at nondining center)=1575


So the total value of meals you're getting is 1875$, but it cost you 1875 if the first fucking place, you may as well have paid in cash!
The only way this deal makes sense is if you eat at dining centers for lunch and dinner, where the cost per meal is 13.50. With that alternative math your value goes to 2025+300=2325 for $1875. But wait theres more! Dining dollars receive a discount of 10% after 600, so if you purchased 600$ it costs 540. With a little math we can calculate the break even point, and you would have to eat at a dining center FOR lunch or dinner at least 121 times before you would get better value than just buying dining dollars. (Assuming you used all flex at full value! Which is difficult to do) There are roughly 75 days in a semester so you would effectively have to eat 1.6 times per day for dinner or lunch to get any increased value. And even if you do manage that, the gains are so insanely marginal, and assume that you spent your flex perfectly. Dining dollars also let you buy other items at campus locations. It makes no sense to purchase that shit. You only get 150 swipes with silver So effectively you can't spend more than 29 swipes anywhere except the dining center for lunch and dinner if you want to get any form of value out of this transaction. Of course the cheapest thing to do is to not eat at ISU, but if you're a lazy fuck like me, you kinda have to spend a premium for their shitty overpriced food.

TL:DR: ISU dining is shit, buy dining dollars if you're lazy, plans are not a good value under basically any circumstance.",1,2,,enwwe9,t1_fe62edy,/r/iastate/comments/enwwe9/best_option_for_food/feen1a0/

4186,Comment,"If you want social and quiet, I think Friley or Helser (if you want to be on the west side) or any of the richardson Ct. dorms (Barton, Lyon, Freeman) 

I lived in Helser my freshmen year, people shit on it but I honestly absolutely loved it. It is very social and people leave their doors open a lot and people will just stop by and say hi as a way to meet people. It is also super convenient, right next to UDCC, the Friley dining hall, and can get almost anywhere on campus really quick. People hate the idea of no AC, however, you only need it for about a month. get a few good fans and you should be fine. Also, Helser has airconditioned study rooms, a tv room, and a air conditioned computer lab, so very easy to find ways to cool off. 

My sophomore and junior year I lived in Freeman and was amazing. With the building being a lot smaller, you won't meet as many people in your dorm, however, people are still pretty social. It gets pretty tight knit. From my understanding, that is how all the buildings are in richardson ct. Freeman also has an airconditioned parlor that people love to hang out in which is a great way to meet friends. Plus it is right next to conversations which in my opinion is the best dining hall on campus. 

If you want a social building, I would advise against suites. I had a lot of friends live in Eaton or Martin. They loved the buildings themselves, however, most people keep your doors closed. For the most part, the non airconditioned dorms seem to be the most social they tell people to ""open up your doors, it can create a cross breeze with the room across from you so you meet people AND help cool your room down"".  Not having air conditioning sucks at first, but after the first few weeks it cools down enough where you don't need it. Get some good fans, especially one to be like right in your face while you sleep to cool you down. Also, try and spend as little time in your room as possible these first few weeks. Go to air conditioned study rooms, go to the library, go to the MU, etc. 

Also, don't be afraid to lead the charge and get people to ""go for a walk"" with you. Early on in the year it is super common to be hanging out with some people in a room and someone will stand up and say ""well, I'm going to go take a walk and meet some people. Anyone want to come with me?"" It is a great way to meet new people (just stop in any room with an open door and say something like ""hi, just walking around trying to get to know people!"" or something like that. People with their door open are waiting for people to come and say hi. They are wanting to be social, if that wasn't the case, they would just shut their doors.

4191,Comment,"*I am summoned...* - Thanks u/Emergen_Cy (and for letting me steal your line)

At the moment, we're planning on operating as usual. Historically, CyRide almost never *cancels* service - I think the last time we did it was due to some major flooding and the building flooded.

At points, we **may** suspend service until conditions improve. If the sirens go off, our procedure is to direct passengers into a close by building. If there are none available, the driver will direct passengers to get as close to the floor as possible and below the window line.

I can imagine this scenario happening quite a few times tomorrow afternoon and into the evening, so I would not expect buses to be on time at all. Definitely plan on missed trips and significant delays. My assumption (and what I'll probably end up directing tomorrow) is that we will wait longer at major points such as Kildee/Bessey, Gilman, UDCC/Student Services, etc. for those waiting inside for the bus.

As far as cancelling or reducing service, that probably isn't something you'll have to worry about. But in case it does happen, make sure to keep an eye on our Website, Facebook and Twitter pages. If anything happens we will post an update there.

And just a personal rant, but if there's any time for students to put their phone down and actually look both ways before crossing the street, tomorrow will be the day. With the wind and thunderstorms and it all happening essentially at night, it will make it very difficult for drivers to see and react to things as they normally would.

*Disclaimer - the above is not an official CyRide statement, and mainly my opinion based off of experience.*

So TL;DR - I wouldn't expect any significant changes to service, but be prepared for delays and/or missed trips. If the sirens go off, the driver will tell you what to do. Stay tuned to social media pages and the website for updates. Pay attention to your surroundings. ^this ^is ^not ^an ^official ^CyRide ^statement.",1,45,,rgjnqd,t1_holaefg,/r/iastate/comments/rgjnqd/severe_weather_threat_for_wednesday_december_15/holnvf4/

I would look at the recordings and likely dismiss them. But the warnings the student get before they are supposed to begin are chilling to me and feel very prison-like.  I select questions that have more critical thinking in them, and I feel it is enough.

4252,Comment,"1. Meal blocks have set values for each swipe depending on which block you get, they range from $10.75 to $11.50 per swipe. When you use a swipe at a residential dining center (UDM, Windows, Seasons, Convos, Storms) you get in no matter the value of your swipe. However if you use it at a retail location like the MU Food Court any extra money left over from that swipe gets lost. So if you have an $11 meal swipe and only get $9 of food that other $2 is wasted.

2. Dining Dollars function the same as cash at all dining locations. Depending on the amount of dining dollars you purchase you will get a discount anywhere from 0-10%. 

3. A meal at a dining center costs $10.50 for breakfast and $13.50 for lunch and dinner.

4. My freshman year I was in a dorm that required a meal plan so I purchased an unlimited plan. Those are really only worth it if you eat 3+ meals a day. If you plan to eat at residential dining centers like Storms I would get the meal block. If you want to eat at retail locations like the Hub, Food Court, or Cafes I would go with dining dollars. Just keep in mind if you live in Towers your closest dining center is Storms which is not open on the weekend.",0,5,,fae3os,t3_fae3os,/r/iastate/comments/fae3os/meal_blocks_vs_dining_dollars/fiya27x/

4256,Post,"Hey all.

This semester is going to suck. I can't imagine being a student during this, and I'm so sorry it's happening to you. I wanted to just remind everyone that the university staff are basically gearing up to have the worst semester of their professional lives, and they are stressed. They will need to be caring and compassionate to students who need support, but (whether they admit it or not) they need care and compassion from you too.

I'm working from home during this, and I hear some of the conversations, the worried voices on my wife's department calls. Staff are terrified about their health, the health of students, their ability to work if schools have to close again. My wife isn't even supposed to be working, as she's on a 9-month contract. But sadly, she's currently spending 20-30hrs per week, unpaid, trying to unfuck her courses, go to department planning meetings, and answer student concerns when she originally intended to have the summer to bond with our newborn. There are hundreds, maybe thousands of other staff similarly sacrificing their summers without pay for the good of the students.

Be patient and kind to each other and ISU employees, and know that everyone wants to do their best.

Stay safe. Wear a mask. Go ISU.

###Welcome/Welcome Back to ISU!

Hello all, welcome/welcome back back to ISU! I hope everyone had a great summer. 

For those of you that don't know me, I'm Mike and I've been with CyRide for almost 9 years now. I started as a driver back in 2015, became a Transit Dispatcher in 2016, became a Transit Trainer in 2022. I'm responsible for onboarding, the early stages of training, and getting trainees their commercial driver's license (CDL.)

I will generally post CyRide updates here each semester to let everyone know what's going on with CyRide and what you can expect for the year. I'll also post updates for any major detours, severe weather, or anything else that might impact service (think 801 day on Saturday, 8/19.)

Since this is a long post, **new riders** skip to the bottom of this post for Rider Tips and Information. There's also a TL;DR at the bottom for the main points of this post.

---


###Fall Schedule

Fall schedule starts today Monday, August 14th, but we will be running a [break schedule](https://www.cyride.com/Home/Components/News/News/3932/1342?backlist=%2f) through Friday, August 18th  since ISU is not in session. If you're looking at a physical printed schedule, the shaded lines on the timetable *do not* operate. The most impacted routes are #9 Plum, #11 Cherry, and #23 Orange, but most routes will have at least a few trips early morning and into the evening that have some sort of impact.

We will be running **full weekend service** on Saturday the 19th and Sunday the 20th due to increased demand. Additionally, Moonlight Express **will** be running on Friday, August 18th and Saturday, August 19th. I will have more details on Moonlight later in this post.

On Monday, August 21st, we will be running full service and all shaded lines in the printed timetable will run pretty much until Thanksgiving Break. 

---

###Route updates for #23 Orange and #9 Plum

We have two main **permanent** route updates that are currently in effect.

Due to CyTown constructions at the Iowa State Center commuter lot, [#23 Orange](https://www.cyride.com/Home/Components/News/News/3930/1342?backlist=%2f) has been **permanently** moved to the Northeast side just across from Hilton Coliseum. See the official route map [HERE](https://www.cyride.com/maps/school-year-maps/individual-pdf-maps/23-orange-map).

* *Please note that the above change for #23 Orange was not ultimately CyRide's decision, and any concerns or comments about the change should be directed at Iowa State University.*

There isn't a very large change for #9 Plum, except that the endpoint has changed to go counterclockwise to S.16th/Duff/Buckeye instead of Buckeye/Duff/S.16th. See the official route map [here](https://www.cyride.com/maps/school-year-maps/individual-pdf-maps/9-plum-map) and note the direction of travel at the endpoint. We typically don't have a significant amount of ridership at this location, so impact should be minimal.

The change for #9 Plum is due to a construction project where a concrete median is being installed on South 16th near Buckeye making the left turn not possible.

---

###Detours

Construction season is finally coming to an end, but there are still a few detours in effect that will go into the Fall schedule.

* The largest detour is on #9 Plum, where we are not currently able to provide service east of South Grand and South 16th street. See #9 plum detour information [HERE.](https://www.cyride.com/Home/Components/News/News/3860/1342?backlist=%2f)

* For #6 Brown, #14 Peach and #25 Gold, there are some stop closures on Stange near Schilliter Village due to road construction making the stops unsafe to service. There is a slight detour for #25 Gold, but stops should not be significantly impacted. See detour updates for these routes [HERE.](https://www.cyride.com/Home/Components/News/News/3874/1342?backlist=%2f)

###Electric buses

Our new battery electric buses have arrived! For the bus nerds out there, they are both Nova LFSe+ models with a range of about 260 miles. This was mainly made possible by the [Low or No Emmision Vehicle Program](https://www.transit.dot.gov/lowno) through the FTA and [Volkswagon Clean Air Act Partial Settlements](https://iowadot.gov/VWSettlement/default.aspx) awarded to the State of Iowa. While they *are* more expensive than your average Gillig Low Floor, these grants covered a large majority of the cost of the buses as well as facility improvement for charging stations.

You will see these two buses on #2 Green and #9 Plum route, as they are newer and both of those routes go by the CyRide facility. If they need to be switched out for any reason, this can be achieved easily without impacting service. In the future, we are planning on expanding where they can go, but for now it will be limited to these two routes.

On a personal note, I was actually shocked on the range of these buses; at first I was very skeptical. During testing, we loaded them with about 10,000lbs of sandbags (average of about 20-25 college students) and drove them around for a few hours. in 2.5 hours of driving on a hot summer day with the AC running full-bore, I only managed to knock off about 15% of the battery. They are very comfortable rides and the braking is very smooth, my only concern is how quiet they are on the road, which brings me to my next point: Campus Safety.

---

###Campus and Pedestrian Safety

*(This section represents my own opinion, and is not officially CyRide's opinion or statement.)*

I've been holding off for a while to bring this up in these updates, but I really think it needs to be addressed. Actually, the reason I'm even bringing it up is because one of my trainees told me about a  rumor he heard as a student which terrifies me. He was told by a fellow student that CyRide buses have sensors that will stop the bus automatically if it senses a pedestrian, so he didn't need to worry about walking out in front of a bus. This is **not** true, and if you hear this please correct it. The only thing that is stopping the bus is the driver's foot on the service brake.

Please, please, *please* retain the habit of looking both ways while crossing the street, especially when you're not at a crosswalk, and try to be predictable when you are going to cross. When you de-board the bus, please cross *behind* the bus if possible, especially if it is not on campus. 

Additionally, please read and pay attention to the [crosswalk timer instructions](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fpreviews.123rf.com%2Fimages%2Fjojoo64%2Fjojoo641602%2Fjojoo64160200125%2F51559572-united-states-mutcd-road-sign-crosswalk-instructions.jpg&tbnid=80H3wSE8ieKtXM&vet=12ahUKEwj-laPCwtWAAxWwG94AHYQWCh8QMygDegUIARDWAQ..i&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.123rf.com%2Fphoto_51559572_united-states-mutcd-road-sign-crosswalk-instructions.html&docid=1-vrnLfXMbG7EM&w=782&h=1300&itg=1&q=crosswalk%20timer%20instructions&ved=2ahUKEwj-laPCwtWAAxWwG94AHYQWCh8QMygDegUIARDWAQ) at busy intersections like Lincoln Way and Welch/Lynn/Ash/Beach. The countdown timer at crosswalks is not how much time for pedestrians to start crossing, it is how much time pedestrians have left to finish crossing once started when the walk light appears but before the countdown timer starts. It might not seem like a big deal to start crossing with 10 seconds left, but that blocks traffic trying to turn and can cause unsafe traffic conditions very quickly.

The above said, I'm not going to pretend that CyRide drivers won't also make mistakes while driving. If you witness any unsafe driving behavior, please report it and we can correct it.

*(Again, this section represents my own opinion, and is not an official CyRide's statement.)*

###Moonlight Express

If you don't know what Moonlight Express is, it is a 100% free service that operates on Friday and Saturday nights from 10:30pm-3:00am while classes are in session. You do not need to pay a fare or show your ISU card to use these services.

Moonlight Express is split into two sections - Fixed route and door to door.

* The Moonlight Express ""A"" shuttle still follows a fixed route and runs every 15 minutes. See the A shuttle map [HERE.](https://www.cyride.com/maps/school-year-maps/moonlight-express-service-maps/moonlight-a)

* If you need a ride outside of the service zone on the ""A"" shuttle, we offer an On-Demand service and can generally get a minibus to you within 10-15 minutes, depending on demand for the night. Call the CyRide office OR download the free [Ride Pingo](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ride-pingo/id1536281958) app through iOS or Android and schedule through that.

We are currently talking about re-implementing a ""B"" shuttle that would service Shilliter Village and Freddy Court, but that is not set in stone yet. If that does happen, I will make sure to post a separate update about it later this semester.

###Rider tips and information

For those of you that are new at ISU, it might be scary or overwhelming to start riding or learn the system. It takes a little bit of time, but you'll quickly get the hang of it.

For starters, you'll only need your ISU ID for any route that doesn't start with a ""20."" For #21 Cardinal, #23 Orange (most popular), and #25 Gold, you don't need to show anything to ride. 

When you board, please *always* enter through the front door as the driver has to tally you. We've had an ongoing problem with people boarding through the rear doors, especially on #23 Orange which does not give us accurate counts. After you've boarded, either find a seat or continue moving all the way to the back of the bus if it's a busy trip. The articulated buses can hold about 90 people, and the past few years we've been ""maxing out"" at 70 because riders leave open seats or don't move all the way back. 

When you're ready to deboard, pull the yellow cord or press the stop request buttons throughout the bus. There are some stops which the bus stops at no matter what, but for the majority of stops, the bus will only stop if it is requested. You can exit through any door, front or rear.

If you're new, start by reviewing our [Maps](https://www.cyride.com/maps/summer-maps) and figure out where you live and which routes go by where you're at. The little dots on the map are all bus stops. From there you'll want to look at the [timetables](https://www.cyride.com/schedules/school-year-schedule-3398) to determine what time the bus will depart near you. The SQUARE marks on the map are all timepoints. Note that those timepoints are all ""departure"" times and not arrival times, so I would give yourself an extra minute or two to ensure you don't miss the bus. 

MyState has great resources for bus predictions, but it isn't perfect. My suggestion would be to use the printed timetable to *plan* your trips and know approximately what time the bus will depart, and use MyState to determine where the bus is at in real time. 

The buses all have printed schedules when you board - I would grab one and read the rider information to learn about it. 

If you have any questions such as needing to plan a trip or transfer information, feel free to give CyRide a call. We generally pick up with 2-3 rings and you don't have to sit through an automated system. Additionally, feel free to message me or leave a comment in this thread.

Back for more!

Recent news from the CDC and the Iowa Department of Public Health has generated a lot of interest in the status of COVID-19 vaccination in the ISU campus community.  *This is not an official ISU statement* (as always, see my flair if you're confused) but I wanted to bring my three loyal readers up to speed on what's happened since [my last post on this subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/kwoo0p/covid_vaccination_update_13_jan_2021/).  Also, *I am not a healthcare professional*, so I may get some details wrong.

This post assumes you've already read my previous post, linked above.  I'm not going to review a lot of that material here.

This is going to be a long post with very little that can be condensed to a meaningful TL;DR.  Please bear with me.  I'll try to break up the major topics for readability.

*****

**Vaccine Development and Approval**

The big news here is that on February 27, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine (otherwise known as the Janssen vaccine - Janssen Biotech is a division of big J&J).  This is significant for a couple of reasons.  First, it opens up additional manufacturing capability.  Second, the Johnson & Johnson formulation is a single-dose vaccine, whereas the existing Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses (""prime,"" or first, and ""boost,"" or second).

That single-dose capability is huge from a logistics perspective.  Scheduling, supply, and staffing have all been major headaches for the organizations across the country that are administering the two-dose vaccines.  Once the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is available in quantity, mass vaccinations will accelerate.

*****

**Vaccine Distribution**

Some of you may have seen me post a shorter version of this explanation over the weekend, but here's a deeper dive into how vaccine is getting from the manufacturers to people's arms.

In the United States, distribution is centrally controlled by the CDC.  For Moderna, the CDC has a distribution contract with McKesson, a company which previously gained experience in nationwide vaccine distribution during the H1N1 influenza pandemic (2009-2010).  Moderna ships to McKesson; McKesson then distributes vaccine to state, territorial, and tribal public health agencies according to CDC guidance.  In Iowa's case, the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) receives the shipments that are destined for our state.  Pfizer looks similar except for the first step - Pfizer ships directly to the state/territorial/tribal agencies rather than letting McKesson handle shipping.

When IDPH receives a vaccine shipment, it then distributes that among all 99 of Iowa's counties, as well as pharmacies in the state that are authorized to dispense vaccine.  At the county level, the local public health agency receives the county allocation.  Depending on county-level capabilities, it then administers the vaccine itself or hands it off to local partners to administer.

In Story County - the county in which ISU is located, for those who aren't sure - our local public health agency is Story County Public Health (SCPH).  When SCPH gets a vaccine drop from the state, they administer some of it themselves.  So far, the rest has been divided among school districts, long-term care facilities (i.e., nursing homes), hospitals (Mary Greeley Medical Center and Story County Medical Center, healthcare clinics (e.g., McFarland), and ISU.

I'm not sure what criteria are being used to guide distribution at any of those levels.  Might be census data (this is why filling out your census forms is important), might be tarot cards.

*****

**Vaccine Numbers**

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has [a page with a bunch of links to CDC data on nationwide distribution numbers](https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines/distribution/index.html).  If you want to crunch those, go there.

In Story County, numbers vary week by week, but we are generally seeing about 1,000 doses per week.  That's combined Pfizer and Moderna, and given the need to administer two doses per patient, that was a net 500 full vaccinations per week.  IDPH recently bumped that up to about 1,250.

Per [IDPH's COVID-19 vaccination status page](https://coronavirus.iowa.gov/pages/vaccineinformation), Story County has fully vaccinated 7,448 people and another 8,017 people have received their prime doses.  We have an estimated 98,000 residents here, including ISU students, so... that ain't a great percentage today.  In the next section, I'll break down who those 15,465 people are.

*****

**Vaccine Prioritization**

This is where it gets fun.  And by ""gets fun,"" I mean ""makes everyone cranky and anxious.""

One of the defining characteristics of a disaster is that the need for resources outstrips the resources that are available to deal with the incident.  This is certainly the case when it comes to COVID vaccine supplies today.  In such situations, the people who own the problem have to start making hard decisions about where those resources will go to have the greatest impact.

The CDC runs a group called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).  ACIP is in charge of making recommendations on how to prioritize COVID-19 vaccine allocation.  CDC passes those recommendations down to state public health agencies, which then have the authority to modify them based on state-level demographics and other factors.  This is important because it's the states, not the federal government, that have the authority to enforce vaccine prioritization under law.  Also, this creates confusion when people see that one state is doing things differently from another state.

In Iowa, IDPH has tweaked its prioritization a couple of times.  The top priority, which is where vaccines started in December, was Phase 1A.  That was healthcare workers (to protect the people who are keeping the rest of us from dying) and long-term care facilities' residents and staff (to protect the largest highest-risk demographic).

Phase 1B, which is where we are now, included a bunch more professional groups.  Because Iowa wasn't getting enough vaccine to take care of all of 1B at once, IDPH subdivided 1B into five tiers.  The info in the following bullet points is copied and pasted from IDPH's site because I want to be sure I'm using their terminology: 

* Tier 1:  First Responders; PK-12 staff, early childhood education, childcare workers

* Tier 2: Frontline essential workers in food, agriculture, distribution, and manufacturing sectors who live or work in non-social distanced settings; Individuals with disabilities living in home settings and their direct care staff

* Tier 3: Staff and individuals living in congregate settings not covered by previous Phase or Tier; Government officials, including staff, engaged in business at the State Capitol

* Tier 4: Inspectors responsible for health, life and safety

* Tier 5: Correctional facility staff and individuals incarcerated

Additionally, Phase 1B includes all persons age 65 and older.  In Story County, McFarland Clinic is doing the heavy lifting there.  They've been working their way through an age-prioritized list of everyone in their patient database.  They started with a 109-year-old and are currently down to the 76-year-olds.  Scroll down a bit [on this page](https://www.mcfarlandclinic.com/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccine) to see an infographic with their current status.

Now I want to point out a few things about the tiers.  First, under 1B Tier 2, the ""essential workers..."" part of that is basically targeting workers in the meatpacking industry who live in bunkhouse-type settings.  Remember the big outbreaks in those plants last spring/summer when everyone was terrified of a bacon shortage?  Yeah.  [That's where Iowa's initial allocation of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is going right now](https://idph.iowa.gov/News/ArtMID/646/ArticleID/158404/Over-100000-Doses-of-Vaccine-Arrive-In-Iowa-This-Week).

Second, IDPH has specifically stated that students in university residence halls are *not* part of Tier 3's ""congregate settings"" clause.  Some other states are doing that differently.

Third, IDPH has explicitly stated that college/university faculty are *not* part of the educators in Tier 1.  Again, some other states are doing that differently.

Last week, IDPH expanded the definition of Phase 1B to *also* include - the quoted text is their own words again - ""Persons age ~~26~~ **16** to 64 years that are or might be at an increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 due to medical conditions listed at at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html""  So there's that, ~~but the lower limit on the age range means the majority of our students are still not eligible to be vaccinated~~.

**Update:** After some digging, it looks like the 26 on IDPH's site, as quoted above, is a typo.  Other IDPH briefing documents say the correct lower age limit for this category is **16**, as flagged by /u/MrRoundJr.

*****

**What Is ISU Doing?**

As I mentioned in the section on distribution, ISU gets a portion of Story County's allocation from SCPH.  Once it gets here, Thielen Student Health Center (TSHC) is in charge of getting it into arms, with support from the team here in the Emergency Operations Center (EOC).

In accordance with IDPH's prioritization phases and tiers, TSHC has been vaccinating ISU employees who fall into 1A and 1B as a result of their jobs.  They've also vaccinated the staff of the three childcare centers associated with ISU, who are not ISU employees but are closely affiliated with the university, and have administered it to a small number of other ISU employees in the 65+ age range.  They've been at the forefront of the university's COVID fight [since before COVID Day One](https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/l6czof/dispatches_from_the_eoc_covid_new_year/) and will be there until we're done with mass vaccinations.  As long as we keep receiving vaccine, they'll continue vaccinating members of the campus community according to the state's prioritization system.

*****

**What's Next?**

In the words of Facebook, ""it's complicated.""

You can see from the numbers above that Iowa and Story County still have a long way to go, and if we assume the current supply levels continue, it's gonna take a while.  On the other hand, President Biden also recently stated that by the end of May, vaccine will be available to everyone in the U.S. who wants it.  That may be just a politician's promise, but it may be an indicator that additional federal resources (including the [Defense Production Act](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/03/02/biden-administration-announces-historic-manufacturing-collaboration-between-merck-johnson-johnson-expand-production-covid-19-vaccines.html)) are being mobilized to hasten the production and distribution processes.  I can't say for sure.

It's not my place to go into too much detail on our plans here.  We have official ISU spokespeople for that.  I think I can safely say that we're looking at a range of possibilities from ""the current trickle continues"" to ""Uncle Joe opens the magic faucet and vaccine flows like water"" and figuring out what resources we'll need to administer each level of that.

The biggest unknown remains timing.  We don't have good visibility into where production is going at a national level or how many doses Iowa or Story County will receive two weeks from today.  Without that, it's impossible to predict when we'll able to go full-throttle ourselves.

I know everyone wants hard answers and a definite date for their own vaccination appointment , but none of us are in a position to give you those today.  Hopefully, the information I've provided and linked in this post will give some readers a better understanding of where we are today and where we're headed in the coming months.  If you've made it this far - thanks for reading, thanks for hanging in there, stay strong, stay masked, and promise me you'll hug a custodian and a TSHC employee when this is over.",45,109,0.99,m0pv9f,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/m0pv9f/dispatches_from_the_eoc_march_vaccine_update/

While using the COM S Windows cluster, I noticed that Canvas redirects the user to a particular endpoint after certain conditions are checked for system requirements. Essentially, WebEx first cycles you through their Java-based system requirements checker and assuming you are using Linux, you most likely don't support the 32-bit dependencies to process these API calls. However, it is possible to bypass this system requirements check in its entirety and skip to the meeting.

**There are two solutions to remedy this issue:**

1. Obtain the Meeting ID and Meeting Password
2. Navigate to [https://iastate.webex.com](https://iastate.webex.com)
3. Click on the *Search for meetings* text field and input the meeting ID
4. Input the meeting password when prompted.

**Or, to replicate how I figured out how to get around this issue:**

1. Obtain the meeting password.
2. Click on the *WebEx* tab of your course page
3. Navigate to a particular meeting and click **Join**
4. You will first arrive on [*https://lti.educonnector.io/webex/meetings/xxxxxx/join/join\_meeting?AT=ST&ST=SUCCESS*](https://lti.educonnector.io/webex/meetings/xxxxx/join/join_meeting?AT=ST&ST=SUCCESS)
5. Assuming you have all the Windows requirements, you will be redirected to [https://iastate.webex.com/webappng/sites/iastate/meeting/download/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx](https://iastate.webex.com/webappng/sites/iastate/meeting/download/1c79c69831888d55c434f457405c0022)
6. Copy this URL from your **Windows system**
7. Navigate to the URL on your **Linux system**
8. Input the meeting password when prompted.

It can be really really tough and excruciatingly lonely, I experienced clinical depression during the mean dips of it last year and had to go to therapy, but just know that all bad things pass and every day that you‚Äôre lonely only makes you that much more Independent.

We're performing emergency maintenance to our wireless controllers tomorrow morning from 5-7am which may result in some blips for those of you connecting through the residence wireless access points. Those of you in Freddy or Eaton with dedicated Ethernet jacks should not experience any disruption. Ethernet and Eduroam will work with 2 small 5-10 second interruptions, but IASTATE will experience a complete service disruption for approximately 20 minutes. If you see your AP flashing funny colors for a little bit, that's expected while software upgrades are performed. If things aren't working after that 7am window ends, feel free to contact the solution center and they'll be happy to take a gander or forward it on to my team.

Just thinking about it kind of just makes me frustrated with how broken things are.  I remember when I had an on-campus job in IT my boss said we had to spend more money on things, since we had a surplus, and if we didn't spend the surplus money we'd have a lower budget than previous years. 

There was a class, CPRE 288, where they added a lot of ""entrepreneur-like"" components to the class, adding a lot more workload to it, and seemingly not related to the class at all.  One student told me that he heard it was because someone made a donation to the department with a condition that they add that component somewhere to the program.  It seems wrong that a private donation can change the course of a class, and I don't know if that's what actually happened, but the whole thing feels kind of sketchy.

There's so much wrong with financial scenarios, in higher education, in politics, and throughout the world.  It's just overwhelming to think about it and feel like it's impossible to change it.

**Update Wednesday 12/15 @ 1145:** I've been a little busy this morning, but you should have seen the official ISU notification by now: https://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2021/12/15/wxupdate.  Please read *all* of that, including the information on final exams.

[The National Weather Service posts its briefing slides here](https://www.weather.gov/media/dmx/DssPacket.pdf).  As of 1158, they still have the ones from 4am up, not the more recent ones from the 1030 briefing call, but that should give you a general idea of what we're looking at.

**Update Thursday 12/16 @ 0913:** Thanks to everyone for understanding that ISU leadership had to make a hard decision on this with limited time and a great deal of uncertainty (which is always the case with potential life-threatening weather).  Campus should be fully back to normal operations at this time.  

If you are having issues with faculty granting accommodations for exams that were rescheduled, please reach out to the Dean of Students' Office (https://www.dso.iastate.edu/).

As if finals week didn't suck enough, the National Weather Service held a briefing call this afternoon to discuss the severe weather threat for Wednesday.

**TL;DR: sustained winds 25 to 40 mph, gusts 55 to 70 mph, possible thunderstorms amplifying gusts to 80 mph or more, isolated tornadoes.  Winds ramping up over the day, first major round between 4:00pm and 8:00pm, then a brief break, then another round overnight.**

While the wind is not currently expected to be as strong as the derecho was, this will be a much longer-lasting weather system.  We can expect these conditions to affect us for as long as 6 to 7 hours.


**Protective Actions**

* *Due to the potential for high wind gusts and windblown debris, treat any severe thunderstorm warnings tomorrow as if they were tornado warnings.  Go indoors, stay away from windows, and be prepared to move to an interior space on the lowest level of the building.*

* Familiarize yourself with the severe weather shelter areas in the buildings where you spend time on campus.  Emergency maps should be posted in central locations (near elevators and stairwells, in most or all classrooms) - look for the green-highlighted areas.  If a tornado warning is issued, move to shelter immediately.  Your life is more important than your final exam.

* Avoid travel Wednesday evening.  If you have to go out, leave extra space between vehicles, minimize all distractions, maintain control of your vehicle with both hands, and avoid traveling next to high-profile vehicles.

* Avoid outdoor activities, even if the warm weather appears inviting.  It's a trap.

* Secure all loose objects and small pets and children that you normally leave outdoors.

* Prepare for power outages.

* Avoid power lines, trees, and other potential falling-on-your-head-or-car hazards.


My team and others across campus will be monitoring this throughout the day, but we may not have time to post here.  Thunderstorms will be moving at up to 60 miles per hour, so warning times will be short.  Be careful out there.",65,193,0.99,rgjnqd,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/rgjnqd/severe_weather_threat_for_wednesday_december_15/

After the incredible ISU win today I went to Campustown with my group to revel in the victory..... And it was miserable.  Seemed like 50% of the buildings were vacant.  The bars weren't open, except Baudelaire, which was sparsely populated.  It's like 14,000 saw an incredible game and immediately got out of the area.

For instance, I applied fall of my senior year in high school and got exactly where I wanted; my little brother, who will be a freshman this year, didn't apply til late spring and is in Wilson also. Like others have said, keep checking AccessPlus, but remember that the people make the housing location good or bad. Good luck!

4446,Comment,"Traditional vs suite is partially preferential. Suite will be more expensive and also will have limited socialization as doors are usually closed in a suite style dorm. I lived in one and really liked it but like I said it's all preference (I made friends with my roommates and through my learning community). Traditional style will give you the ""college experience"". 

AC vs no AC is also preference. I do absolutely terrible in heat so I knew that AC was a must for me but other people can do absolutely fine without it so it depends on how you are. 

Dining food is mid. It's not terrible but it's not great. I personally really like food and love good food so it's probably a little different for me.

Once the questions became creepy like the latter I started lying but at first he seemed like mid 20's and normal.

**Vaccine Approval**

The big news here is that on Monday, August 23, the FDA issued full approval for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine ([FDA press release here](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine)).  The Pfizer formulation, which will be sold under the brand name Comirnaty (pronounced like ""community"" in southern Kentucky), is approved for use in individuals age 16 and over in its current two-dose series.  Its emergency use authorization (EUA) remains in effect for individuals 12 to 15, and for a third dose in certain immunocompromised individuals.

If you have been holding off on vaccination until the EUA was replaced by a standard approval, this is your sign.  ISU has the Pfizer vaccine available - [see here for clinic dates/times/sites](https://web.iastate.edu/safety/updates/covid19/vaccinations).  

Based on what I know today, my opinion is that we will not see a change in Iowa Board of Regents policy around vaccine requirements.  As discussed in other threads, [Iowa House File 889](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/legislation/BillBook?ba=HF%20889&ga=89) prohibits any Iowa state government entity from requiring proof of (edited to add:) *COVID* vaccination for entry to its premises.

*****

**ISU HR Policy Items**

Late on Friday, August 20, ISU received approval from the Board of Regents for two policy changes.

First, [course modality changes and telework are available to employees who are immunocompromised or who have immunocompromised household members](https://iastate.service-now.com/isu?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0014227&sys_kb_id=bd9b3a9edb8a34506752a565ca961927).  More details and the required medical documentation form can be found at that link.

Second, [COVID sick leave is available for both regular employees and hourly/temporary/seasonal employees, *including student workers*](https://iastate.service-now.com/isu?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0014229&sys_kb_id=4a7cf2dedb8a34506752a565ca961904).  More details can be found at that link.

Both of these links have been added to the COVID megathread.

*****

**Vaccine Expiration Extended**

This is only relevant to those with a vested interest in the implementation details of mass vaccination, but I'm including it because it is very welcome news to me and my healthcare colleagues.  On Monday, August 23, we received news that the FDA has extended the lifespan of Pfizer's vaccine from six months to nine months if it's kept in ultra-cold storage (-90¬∞C to -60¬∞C).  This significantly extends the usability of a lot of Pfizer vaccine stockpiles around the country, which were going to expire at the end of August.  Combined with the announcement of FDA approval, this means those doses are now usable through November to vaccine people who were waiting for the approval.

(No changes were made to the vaccine formulation.  This update is based on stability data the FDA collected from batches produced since last November.)",16,46,0.91,pbb2r5,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/pbb2r5/periodic_unofficial_covid_update_august_25_2021/
4502,Post,"I believe I'm in the majority when I say I did not like finding the mandatory mental health course on my canvas page. However, I actually did the course, and I still have some *dislike*. Instead of keeping it built up inside myself, I shall instead bestow upon you all my mental health tips for both you and those around you.

**-For Yourself-**

In airplanes, you may notice that on safety equipment that it says to help yourself before you help others. This is for good reason: if you don't help yourself first, you may endanger both yourself and whoever you're trying to help, and may not be able to save either of you. When focusing on mental health, make sure yours is stable first before trying to help others; and if yours begins to fall when trying to help, understand that it's OK to step away to pick yourself back up first.

**Food - You need it**

Surprise: you need to eat food to survive. Another surprise: the type of food you eat can be linked to your mental health ([link](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/nutritional-psychiatry-your-brain-on-food-201511168626)). Eating healthier foods can lead to a healthier mindset, or at least a reduction in depressive symptoms. All the processed foods and sugars of the modern world lead to a poorer mental state. Try eating a fruit every once and awhile, maybe even a vegetable if you're feeling adventurous. It may make you feel better.

**Water - You also need it**

Water is extremely important in case you couldn't tell. You're body is about 60% water, and you're brain is about 70% water. Can you guess what happens to your body and mental state if you don't drink enough water? If you guessed ""bad emotional state"" you would be correct! ([link](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6147771/)) Go chug some plain water. NOT SODA, NOT GATORADE, NOT ICED TEA; PLAIN H20.

**Hobbies - The fun stuff**

So you're doing the stuff needed to survive. That's good, but it's nothing without the reason to live: aka the stuff you actually want to do. Hobbies decrease your stress-levels and give you some breathing room before hurling yourself back into life. You need to reduce stress, otherwise it can manifest in some... poor ways, such as anxiety, depression, and even physical symptoms like sickness if not taken care of.

*""But I don't have any hobbies""*

Great news, the world is full of things to do, and a lot of them don't require much or anything at all. Here's a short list of things you can try that only require you and maybe a phone:

\*Drawing (landscapes, portraits, doodles)

\*Writing (short stories, a full novel, reddit posts, ect)

\*Photography (take out your phone and snap some shots)

\*Music (Pick up an instrument someone left behind or sing until your roommates kick you out)

\*Collecting things (Campus has some nice rocks you could make a collection out of)

*""But my hobbies don't interest me anymore""*

That's depression, buddy. You're already in the fray of some mental health issues. Try gently forcing yourself to do something you used to enjoy for 10 minutes. You may not want to do it at first, but if you get into the flow you'll feel better afterwards.

**The Socials**

Humans are social creatures; it's how we got to where we are today. Remember to hang out with people you like and to not isolate yourself, otherwise you may find yourself facing some bad brain vibes. It's one of the big reasons mental health issues have increased since quarantine: people can't interact with others and their mental health plummets. If you can't go out, make a call. Can't speak, send a text. They won't make the same impact as hanging out in person, but it's better than nothing.

**Meditation - It's not that bad**

Meditation is one of the BIGGEST things every therapist has ever gotten on my ass about. But they never told me HOW, only that I need/should do it. When I finally found good resources, I realized it doesn't have to be sitting crossed-legged in a dark room chanting to myself. Better still, meditation is ""fully customizable"", so if this doesn't work for you, you can change aspects (or the whole shi-bang) to match what you need.

1. Sit comfortably

or lay down, or lean against a wall; whatever makes you relax. You want to be able to be at ease for a few minutes, so do what needs to be done.

2.  Check yourself

I can't think of a better way of putting this, but as you are sitting (laying, whatever), note how your body feels. Does your leg hurt, are your hands tense, is your jaw clenched? Just think about how you feel in your body. Check in with yourself.

2b. Relax

Those issues you noticed like 5 seconds ago? Remedy the ones you can. If your jaw is clenched, unclench it. If your hands are tense, try gently stretching them. If your leg is in pain, try massaging it briefly, but if the pain is mild enough or you cannot fix it in the moment, you may ignore it.

3. Breathe (but structured)

Fun fact: the way you're breathing can affect the mood you're in. Rapid breaths can make you tense and anxious, while calm, deep breaths help you relax ([link](http://medcraveonline.com/MOJAP/MOJAP-03-00108.pdf)). The geniuses of the ancient world realized we can use this to our advantage during meditation. Try slowing down, and breathing and exhaling to a certain count (such as inhaling for 5 seconds, exhaling for 5 seconds, and repeating) while you're sitting, keeping track in your head.

4. Observe your thoughts

Most of the day, you're likely focused on having the most productive thoughts. Anything that doesn't help in the moment or in the future is pushed aside for a better thought. NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR THIS. Instead, let every thought pass through, not interacting with any of them positively or negatively. Think of it as cloud watching if you must.

Congratulations, you've learned how to meditate. Yes, it's that easy

*""OK, but what if I want to be hardcore about meditation?""*

Then I'd think you're a masochist but I have more for you:

1. Try meditation music or subliminals to help you relax more. This gives the additional benefit of blocking out excess noise around you and lets you concentrate on breathing/watching your thoughts
2. Try the 4-7-8 breathing method, where you inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7 seconds, exhale for 8, and repeat. It's one of the most common breathing patterns used in meditation and is surprisingly quick in its effects.
3. Note where your thoughts go. You're still just watching them, but as they pass you may realize connections between them that give greater insight to your inner emotional state.
4. Do more research. Meditation, because of its uniqueness to each individual, has SO MUCH stuff about it on the internet. Research more about it, and

**Get help**

I know it better than most; sometimes you can't help yourself. You need to seek out help from others sometimes. It may just be talking things through with a friend or parent, or it can be scheduling an appointment with a therapist or counselor. You need to realize it's ok to ask for help; you deserve it far more than most people are willing to accept. Campus has resources, but you can find others online

*On-Campus Counseling* \- There is counseling available on campus, with a choice between group and individual. [https://www.counseling.iastate.edu/services/counseling/](https://www.counseling.iastate.edu/services/counseling/)

*The NIH* \- Lots of resources for finding help around you and phone lines when you need to talk. [https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/find-help/index.shtml](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/find-help/index.shtml)

*Bliss* \- Interactive depression therapy using CBT thought-processes to help you rewire yourself into thinking less like a depressed person. Also free 8 sessions, much easier than a therapist, but not a replacement. [https://cimhs.com/](https://cimhs.com/)

*MentalHealth.gov* \- The government does care; full of resources such as finding the warning signs, how to get help, and more. [https://www.mentalhealth.gov/](https://www.mentalhealth.gov/)

**Wait**

The storm doesn't care that you had plans, and persists anyhow. Sometimes, even doing everything right you will have bad days. Understand it, and don't beat yourself up for it. Just wait out the storm, and pick up the pieces when it passes.

**-For Others-**

Congrats, you're functional! Or more so, since you can help and may choose to help others. Remember that it‚Äôs OK to step away if a situation affects your mental health, and that sometimes you as an average person may not be correctly suited to help someone in a poor mental state. If you can help someone, however, here are a few things to remember.

**How to recognize issues in others**

In short, you can't all the time. Some people will be quieter, some will get louder. Some will eat less, some will eat more. Some will not even show any signs to the outside world until the worst happens. Instead of looking for specific signs, instead look for things that are different in particular to your person. Know your person, and if their behavior changes, ask them about it. It may open them up to discussing what's been going on.

**Listen**

I don't care if there is a singing baboon behind the person. If they're talking, you're listening. Don't interject, don't take the conversation off topic, don't ignore them. Listen. Speak when necessary/when you would usually, but try to listen as much as possible. The person you're listening to will appreciate a friendly ear to hear them out more than a conversation about sport-ball.

**Be natural**

My biggest gripe with the mandatory mental health course (aside from being mandatory) was that the situation it showed was sterile and textbook as hell. What do I mean? When was the last time you had a conversation even close to how theirs played out? Exactly. Try to keep the conversation natural. If you normally make jokes, you can still make jokes. If you like telling stories you can tell a story. Remember to listen, but also realize that suddenly treating the person you're talking to differently can be isolating and upsetting, which will not help a mentally unhealthy person.

**Include them in activities**

You may find that your friend has been distant for awhile. This may be them isolating themselves due to some mental health issues. Remember to try and include them in plans, even if they always refuse. The gesture means more than they may let on, and reminds them of the people who care about them.

**Know when to step away**

You can‚Äôt help everyone as much as you want to. Sometimes, you have to let professionals do their jobs. If someone is suicidal, there isn‚Äôt much you as a normal person can do. Be able to step away and call people who can help. The resources from above may be useful for finding numbers to call.

&#x200B;

Congratulations, you made it to the end. Instead of a certificate of completion, I'll give you this ascii cat - > =\^..\^=

&#x200B;

EDIT: Additional Points for Self-Care:

&#x200B;

**SLEEP**

Look, I know you have shit to do, we all do. But you're not doing yourself any favors by staying up into the night. Not sleeping causes more mental troubles, which causes more trouble sleeping (a real catch-22 there, eh?) (([https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-10343-008](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-10343-008))). Do yourself a favor and get in some uninterrupted sleep. Your work will still be there in the morning, and you'll do a much better job well rested than not.

**Go Outside**

Groundbreak-Dot18 made this point below, but it bears repeating: go outside! The sunlight can be good for both your mental and physical health ( ([https://www.cfp.ca/content/cfp/52/4/422.full.pdf](https://www.cfp.ca/content/cfp/52/4/422.full.pdf))). If you can't go outside, try sitting by an open window to get that sweet vitamin D. Sitting outside in the sunlight is better than sitting inside in the dark.

**Exercise**

I have a love-hate relationship with exercise, as I'm sure some of you do as well. But getting just a little bit of sweat in a day will ease some of the mental strain of life (([https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/depression-and-exercise/art-20046495](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/depression-and-exercise/art-20046495))). Find some activity you can do and try to do it daily. I do yoga on my good days and a single sit-up every hour on bad days. It doesn't have to be hard, just something to give your heart beating.

**Hygiene**

Some days, you're not going to want to get out of bed. That's fully valid, but try to remain clean. Even just a wet rag on the face and underarms will make you feel better than sitting in your stink (no resources here, just personal experience). If you have the energy, try brushing your teeth and showering. Even if you do nothing else during the day, you'll still feel better.

**Social Media**
Who could've guessed, social media can be a pest on the ol' noggin, especially in ""unpreceded times"". Remember to give yourself breaks from social media every once and awhile (yes, even Reddit). Too much social media involvement can increase your feelings of loneliness and depression, which is not helpful when you're already vulnerable (([https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/10.1521/jscp.2018.37.10.751](https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/10.1521/jscp.2018.37.10.751))). Use that time to meditate, do a hobby, or even just sit and look out a window.

4523,Post,"I just want to say before I start rating the classes that everyone is different in a way, some people find some classes easier than others and I just want to give a rating that reflects on what I think was hardest classes I‚Äôve taken to ones where I think were the easiest. This can give you a general understanding of what you can expect from the class. I‚Äôll also be sharing what professors I‚Äôve had and rate the class on a scale from 1-10 in terms of difficulty and list the from the hardest to the easiest. I‚Äôll also list when I took the class (fall 23 or spring 24), credits hours, core class or not, and say whether it a full semester class or half a semester class. 

Alright here are my rankings: 

1. Civil engineering 274 (Statics), core class, 3 credits, full semester, fall 23, professor: Harntaro Wibowo. Difficulty: 9.5/10
All I can say is listen to the rumors about this class. When I was in CE 160 everyone was saying that statics is going to be the hardest class you‚Äôll ever take at ISU, even the TA‚Äôs were telling us that. I have always been optimistic and never really thought of it until I took the class. I mean what can I say, first 80% of your grade are the exams and the other 20 is homework, Top-hat etc. Second the material of this class especially in the beginning is kind of hard to keep up with as everything builds up with each other but you do get used to it. When I tell you that you can‚Äôt fuck up one exam you really can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs almost impossible to get a good grade if you fuck up one of them. You‚Äôll have 3 midterms and 1 final, 4 questions on each exam and 90 minutes. The exams are not impossible to solve obviously but they do try to trick you by for example finding the mass instead of weight, unit conversions, and complex wording. Pros about this class is platoons are really helpful for this class (TA‚Äôs giving out examples and showing you how to solve them, once per week for 50 min) and if you do go to all of the platoons you do get 2% extra on your final grade. Also SI was helpful as she did give out a lot of examples from previous exams and would recommend going to them. Wibowo wasn‚Äôt a bad professor he does recommend printing out the practice example sets before each class because that‚Äôs what he goes over the whole class period but I wouldn‚Äôt say he is the best at all in terms of 1 on 1 conversations. Also the graders of this class in my opinion are kind of harsh when grading your exams, they can deduct you up to like 5 points for wrong units or wrong answers which I found ridiculous. Overall be prepared for this class, get up to date with 3D related material,Fy,Fx, and moment equations, and a lot of trigonometry.

2. Civil Engineering 206 (Engineering economic analysis and professional issues in civil engineering), core class, 3 credits, full semester, spring 24, professor: Jon Matthews Rouse, difficulty: 8.7/10
If you told me back when I was applying for this class at the end of fall that CE 206 was going to be hard as fuck I would‚Äôve laughed at you, but holy fuck it is. Firstly I want to get this out of the way, I wanna say that some classes are hard not because the material is hard but because the professor makes it hard. CE 206 falls into that category where the material is basically high school maths with plugging and chugging numbers into formulas but holy fuck does Matt make it ridiculously hard in his exams. Matt is a great guy and an excellent professor (top 5 coolest professors I‚Äôve ever met), gives dad vibes when you meet him, but he is no joke in his exams. Some of his questions are ridiculous where he really tries to trip you up with the wording and his work out problems are really long and tedious. He also admitted that he does plug numbers into a calculator to see where students might trip up (like squaring your answer when you‚Äôre supposed to multiply) and puts the number as one of the multiple choices. He also doesn‚Äôt post anything on canvas at all which I found ridiculous since the first page of each exam is solving true and false questions, full in the blank, definitions, etc..Oh yeah you only got 55 minutes for the midterm exams, which I found hard to even see how you could ever finish both the midterm exams (especially the second one) on time. His second exam was so bad, 60-70% failed the exam, and had to curve it by 10%. The homework‚Äôs weren‚Äôt bad but his graders are really tough graders, I mean I never got a full mark on any of the homework‚Äôs and I had 13 homework sets. No wonder why this class is the 5th dropped class at ISU, it‚Äôs literally impossible to finish both midterm exams on time, graders for the homework are tough, and no room for extra credit (beside doing only extra credit homework but still).

3. Engineering mechanics 324 (mechanics of material), core class, 3 credits, full semester, spring 24, professer: Oleg Zarechnyy, difficultly: 7.7/10
The content in this class is arguably way harder than what you take in statics but when it comes to grading and overall the class structure, this class is not bad. If you take it with Oleg (great professor) his method of teaching is TBL (team base learning) and the class structure is to watch the lecture videos before attending the class, as what you do in class is 2 top-hat questions on the material you watched at home. He also recommends to do the homework before each lecture but I never did and it was fine. The team you are with the whole semester are picked at random and you sit in the same place during the semester. The top hat questions aren‚Äôt tricky but if you did not watch the videos you won‚Äôt get the answers right. Each question is about 25 min, the first 12 min you do it alone, then the remaining 13 min you discuss your answers with your teammates and submit them together. You do also submit your answers when you do it alone. Exams are easier than statics exams by a mile, I mean some of the questions they give you the moment of inertia, sometime they give you the forces, etc‚Ä¶ basically all the calculations that you might trip up they will give you. The formula sheet is essential to this class, so understand where everything is. There are 3 midterm exams, 3 questions, and 90 min (30 min avg each question), very doable. They never try and trick in any of the questions like in statics and it‚Äôs pretty straight forward. The final will have 4 questions but you got 120 min so again doable. You have also 3 homework‚Äôs each week due Monday, Tuesday, and Friday on Willyplus. Overall a very doable class (class avg on each exam was about 75-80%) and shouldn‚Äôt be hard to pass.

4. Deferential equations 266 (differential equations), not a core class, 3 credits, half a semester, spring 24, Professor: Domenico D‚ÄôAlessandro, difficulty: 7/10
Out of the math classes I‚Äôve taken so far at ISU, Calc1, calc2, and Def eq 266, I would say that def eq is definitely the easiest out of the 3 I have taken. This class is supervised by the one and only Steve butler so I already knew it wasn‚Äôt going to be batshit hard like the calc department but don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a walk in the park type of class. For me this class is all about proving that a certain problem is right by proving it with a set of equations. What I like about this class is 3 things, first and most importantly is that the exams are fair not ridiculously hard like the calc exams but not easy to the point where you didn‚Äôt have to study, second you could theoretically not attend a single lecture like I did 99% of the time and just go to the quiz review (more on that in a moment) and try and understand what they are talking about (which wasn‚Äôt hard to comprehend) and do well enough on the quizzes to be ready for the exams, and thirdly there‚Äôs a fucking formula sheet thank god. If it wasn‚Äôt for the formula sheet I promise you this class would be 10x harder cause you do need a lot of equations for this class. Exam wise there will be 2 for 266, 6 questions each, and 75 minutes, which I think is fair considering some questions are really easy and fast to solve and some do take time but I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs like a 20 minute question more like 7-8 minute question. For me quizzes were the best as like in calculus you have a weekly quiz 25 min, 2 random questions from the practice quiz you have to solve, and as I said if you go the quiz review and understand what is happening it‚Äôs Literally a free 10/10. Exams are 60%, quizzes are 25%, Homework are 12% (you only need to do 3 questions form the sample set to get full credit), and the remaining 3% is basically free points if you do the weekly review where it asks how are doing in class, recommendations, etc. overall very doable class with a lot of chances to get a good grade as he does drop your lowest 2 exam questions, 1 quiz, and 4 homework sets. I can‚Äôt tell you if the professor is solid or not as I rarely went to class besides doing the quizzes but from what I gathered he is ok. 

5. Statistics 305 (Engineering statistics), not a core class, 3 credits, full semester, spring 24, instructor: Troy Meyers, difficultly: 6.7/10
This is the exact reverse of CE 206, the content here is hard, in my personal opinion, but Troy makes his exams really easy. First off I wanna say that Troy is one the funniest professors I‚Äôve ever met, he tells us cool and funny stories, he really wants you to succeed in this class by helping and asking questions, and he really is passionate about statistics. The material is hard but his exams are literally the example material he posts on canvas along with of the homework questions. I mean if you can memorize the practice material on canvas you‚Äôll be just fine as most of the time he doesn‚Äôt even change the numbers in the exam (keeps it the same). The first 2 exams were really easy, the third exam I failed it just because I stoped going to lecture and didn‚Äôt even go to the exam, but the avg was really high just don‚Äôt be a dumbass like me, the final is recycled material from the 3 midterms along with questions from post 3rd exam. The homework is really easy if you understand what you are doing. Honestly this class could be hard if you don‚Äôt take it with Troy. Oh yeah DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS ONLINE! I heard they make the online sections of this class ridiculously hard, just take it with Troy he teaches like 7 sections of this class, so you should find more than enough seats to be in his sections.

6. Chemistry 167 L (chemistry 167 lab), not a core class, 1 credit, full semester, fall 23, Instructor: Krishna Suresh, difficulty:6.2/10
This class for 1 credit is absolutely bullshit. Firstly the ‚Äúprofessor‚Äù for this class is named Sarah Pistolesi but you never actually meet her or even talk to her ever, even if you tried to send an email she will never respond. So what you have is a post graduate instructor and about 15 other students in a laboratory doing chemistry. What I was hoping for this class is to do dope ass chemistry experiments and overall have a chill and easy time but nope this class is the literal definition of aids. You do about 13 experiments throughout the semester and I would classify 1 experiment as cool and rest absolutely ass, you have to do a fat ass report on your experiment, and you also have 3 in class experiment exams throughout the semester, you have a pre lab quiz, post lab quiz, and post lab EXAM each fucking week (all online though). I mean all that for 1 credits is insane and they weren‚Äôt easy quizzes or exams nah they were the ones where you actually had to read the lab manual thoroughly and do the labs precisely to do well on them. The pain in ass really was the lab reports, some of my lab reports were like 8-13 pages long as they ask you a shit ton of questions about the experiment you did that week along with a review on what you did, you had to make graphs from excel, and solve stoichiometric questions which as I said before is insane for a 1 credit class. I mean I put more effort into this class than fucking Calc 1 and that‚Äôs not even a joke. Now the instructor (Krishna Suresh) is really cool though and does understand our pain for this class I mean this was her first time teaching this class and was astonished by the amount of work you had to put for 1 credit. She did her best and did sometimes allow us to go early because for some reason there is no fucking chairs to sit on and the lab was 3 hours long so you had to stand up to 3 hours straight with no breaks at all. Smh that class was a joke on god and unless you are a chem major you aren‚Äôt going to get an A on this class, also some of the questions were ridiculously hard to solve unless you know chemistry for real for real.

7. Speech com (Speech communication), not a core class, 3 credits, full semester, fall 23, Professor: Michael Wettengel, difficulty: 5/10
Out of all the classes on this list this class is the dullest class I‚Äôve taken so far. In fact it‚Äôs so dull I can‚Äôt even tell you how the grades were distributed because he goes off by points, and not by percentage but what I can tell about this class is that you have to put effort into your speeches. In this class you will have 3 major speeches, 3 or 4 mini speeches, lots of homework, and in class activities. For your mini speeches all you have to do is write a speech 2-4 min long on a index card-s and read it to your fellow classmates, obviously it‚Äôs not that straightforward as you need to come up with the plot and stuff but that wasn‚Äôt bad. For the major speeches you had to make a PowerPoint for your first two speeches along with references and research to prove on what you are taking about and obviously a rehearsed speech you have to prepare and present to the class. You got a lot of homework you have to do but honestly they were just stepping blocks for the presentation and speech you were going to give for your major speeches so it wasn‚Äôt bad. Finally the in class activities weren‚Äôt bad but they were silly especially at the beginning. Oh yeah for this class you have attend as there is attendance points and also for the in class activities you had basically each class. The main speeches were an informative, persuasive, and special occasion. The first one (informative) was in my opinion the most annoying one as you had to do a lot of research for your topic along with pictures, slides, references, etc. The second (persuasive) was actually not bad as you would want to keep the same topic from the informative one and just persuaded on why your topic is important. For the third one (special occasion) it was the easiest as no research was needed and you can really talk about anything you want. For the first two speeches you had to get your topic approved by the professor but the third one you don‚Äôt have to as long as you and another class mate aren‚Äôt talking about the same topic. Michael wasn‚Äôt a bad professor at all, he actually made the class quit fun it was just the material and over overall speech com is boring. He is a tough grader though and does take the speeches seriously and will deduct points accordingly to the speeches rubric. Honestly the only reason I give this class a 5/10 in difficulty is the amount of effort you have to for this class and not because the material is hard. 

8. Civil engineering 170 (Graphics for civil engineers), core class, 2 credits, full semester, fall 23, professor: Stuart Nielsen, difficulty 4.25/10
What made this class instantly easier than the rest of the civil engineering classes is that the class is online and even if it wasn‚Äôt I think it would easier than the other civil engineering classes. Firstly no exams in this class which is already great, secondly it‚Äôs easy to follow up in this class meaning you don‚Äôt have to watch the lecture videos multiple time to understand what‚Äôs happening you can watch it once and easily see what he is talking about. There are 12 homework sets, and 2 projects that‚Äôs it. The homework sets are: first 2 weeks you do sketches, 2D, and 3D drawings with building objects. You also learn how to draw thing on a side view, top view, etc in 2D and 3D. The next 5 weeks you will use AutoCAD learning how to use it and using its tools, a bit surveying, etc.., then 1 week to do the final project on AutoCAD which is literally what you did on the app for the last 5 weeks compressed into a final project. The the next 5 weeks you do Revit which was actually really fun in my opinion, you learn how to design and build a building on Revit, floor plans, put objects, sceneries, etc‚Ä¶, and then 1 week to the final project which was basically to build a house with a few requirements. Honestly this class is really easy and I would say the hardest thing about this class was the AutoCAD final project was a bit tricky but once you get used to AutoCAD it‚Äôs only honestly cake. Revit is in my opinion easy and simple to understand, its tools are not complex and the rendering on the app is great. Stuart is a great guy and although you don‚Äôt really meet him he does put a lot of effort into his videos and does respond to emails.

9. History 202 (Introduction to western civilization), not a core class, 3 credits, half a semester, spring 24, professor: John Monroe, difficulty: 3.6/10
I never thought I would enjoy learning about history and this class did not disappoint. It‚Äôs a fun class to learn about European history (Napoleon, French Revolution, WW2) and John‚Äôs videos are fun to watch. It does get boring sometimes but that‚Äôs when some of the history was boring but I wouldn‚Äôt say I slept or anything like that. You do quizzes weekly but honestly if you do watch the lecture videos then you shouldn‚Äôt have any problems. You might not take an A on this class as some of the questions are detailed (you need to read the questions carefully) but you will definitely enjoy the class. 

10. Anthropology 230 (globalization, and the human condition), not a core class, 3 credits, half a semester, fall 23, professor: Sedi Azirani, difficulty: 2.8/10
Im going to make this short and simple, watch the lecture videos, do the weekly quizzes, do a essay every 2 weeks, review the course for the final exam, take the final exam and you‚Äôll get an easy A. The only tricky part about this class is the essays as you have to watch a video (usually there will be 2 to choose from) get a reference source and write an essay about the video topic. Quizzes are easy if you watch the videos and look at the slides, and the final exam is easy if you review the material. Honestly an easy A. 
11. English 250 (written, oral, visual, and electronic composition), not a core class, 3 credits, full semester, fall 23, professor: Paul Kimumwe, difficulty: 1/10
If you have taken any english class from ISU you should know that they are an easy A. I put literally 0 effort into this class and still got a 98% on it. You literally do 4 or 5 major essays of your liking as long as you follow their simple requirements and you do 1 power point slide towards the end of the semester explaining your future plans with your degree and I would say thats about it. I mean the only way to fail this class is literally not to submit anything but you really do need a free A from time to time to boost your gpa and luckily this class is a requirement for any degree you take here.

Final thoughts: 

This year, I tried to get out of the way the bullishit classes like my SSH electives, and the easy classes so I can get to the good stuff in the future without a annoying and unnecessary class that I‚Äôm forced to take that literally isn‚Äôt a engineering class, so I would say that this year was a smooth sailing but probably won‚Äôt be next year as I‚Äôm going to take some tough ass classes. I hope I have given y‚Äôall some insight to these classes if y‚Äôall ever gonna take them especially for future Civil engineers.

4529,Comment,"Let me start by saying that anything I am about to say is my own opinion.

Ultimately, the decision to open comes from the top, which means the Board of Regents. Since they have decided that we should reopen, we will reopen (that is the answer to your question).

As faculty, we are well aware, painfully so, that things are not looking great right now. and in a lot of ways fully online makes sense. On the other hand, college is about more than learning, it is about meeting people who are very different from you and being exposed to new ideas and experiences, things which cannot be easily done in a virtual setting; there is a strong case for in-person classes in general, and this pandemic is not going to be the death of the university system.

I believe that the administration is working to do their best to keep people safe and provide them with the right mix of opportunities. The decisions made are not made lightly. If we work together to consistently use PPE, avoid risky activities (going into crowded bars), and follow the guidelines (especially about physical distancing), it will be possible to keep the school open for the duration of the semester. Remember, the idea of wearing the mask is to protect the people around you, I wear my mask to keep you safe, and (I hope) you wear your mask to keep me safe.

Ultimately it comes down to our actions and how much we respect and care about our fellow Iowa State denizens as to what will happen this semester.",0,35,,i6qqq0,t1_g0xlfhf,/r/iastate/comments/i6qqq0/ama_with_the_calculus_coordinator_steve_butler/g0xnhr6/

4545,Post,"Hey all! It seems like we always eventually circle back around to steam tunnel posts in this sub so I wanted to drop some information here for people who actually use the search function. I currently work on campus and have been through a lot of the steam tunnel system so my information is first-hand.

***Are there motion sensors and alarms?*** Yes, and those alarms ring right into the DPS. Students have been caught and charged. FP&M and the DPS would both appreciate people staying out of the tunnels unless they are with an employee who has authorization to be there.

***Why can't we go into the tunnels?*** The tunnels were never meant for human comfort or convenience. Over the past few decades, lights and ventilation have been added to give the workers who have to go into the tunnels a safer working environment, but it is not a place you'd want to hang out. Also, those lights are not always on.

***Are the tunnels dangerous?*** The University has taken steps to reduce the risk of injury to people in the tunnels but there is only so much you can do with old concrete tunnels. Structurally, most of the tunnels seem safe to me but there are a few that I try to get through quickly. Notice I didn't say that I ""walk"" through them quickly. Since these tunnels weren't built for convenience, there are a lot of areas where I can't stand up. Did I mention it's not a place you'd want to hang out? Some are only 3'x3' box culverts. A lot of the walls and ceilings are fine but there are areas that have concrete falling off. There used to be asbestos insulation on the steam pipes but that has been almost completely removed and replaced with safer options, but not 100%. Speaking of the steam pipes, they carry steam at around 95 psi. That's about 3 times the pressure of the air inside of a car tire. The steam is also around 335 degrees fahrenheit. The insulation can only stop so much heat from escaping which means the tunnels can get very warm.

***Are the tunnels dirty?*** Yes. I would not recommend that anyone go into the tunnels in anything that can't be washed easily. There is at least *some* water standing in a lot of the tunnels. Generally it's not much but my boots are waterproof for a reason. The earliest tunnels were dug by hand with picks and shovels and then the walls were either brick or poured concrete. This is fine for keeping dirt out but unfortunately they can allow ground water to get in.

***Can you go from building to building using the tunnels?*** No, not really. There are *some* buildings that have access doors to the tunnels, but not all. Given what I've already said about the conditions inside the tunnels, hopefully it's no surprise that I'd much rather walk above ground if I need to go somewhere.

***Were the tunnels ever designed to be bomb shelters?*** No. I've heard a some interesting theories about the tunnels but unfortunately they were only designed to hold pipes. The tunnels weren't critical to the Manhattan project. There was never a tunnel system to get students around campus when it was cold. No secret tunnels exist to move hazardous chemicals or nuclear waste.

***Are there monsters or ghosts in the tunnels?*** Maybe. I haven't seen anything worse than spiders and insects but you never know what's lurking around the next corner... My guess is no, there are no monsters or ghosts.

***Why can't they just bury the steam pipes like water pipes?*** That's a great question! The short answer is that air is a very good thermal barrier. The windows in our homes generally have 2 or 3 glass layers that are separated by a small air gap. This greatly increases the insulating factor of the windows. The same is true for the steam pipes. ISU does have some steam pipes that are buried directly in the ground but those pipes are a small percentage of the total pipe and they have a lot of insulation around them. Also, steam pipes have a lot of valves, fittings, steam traps, etc. Repairing or replacing any of these items is much easier and less expensive if the pipe is accessible without using excavators and closing down roads. One thing that people also forget is that the ground has a lot of water. Water is very good at stealing heat from pipes. Pipes sitting in water is not a good situation when your goal is to transport heat around campus.

***At the beginning, you said something about being in the tunnels with an authorized employee. Can we really do that without getting in trouble?*** Yes! Tours are given for several utilities systems including the power plant and the steam tunnels! You and up to 14 of your closest friends can all go at once! [Here is a link to a story about the tours and how to schedule one!](https://www.inside.iastate.edu/article/2022/07/21/tunnelguides) Since this article, Mike Murray has left ISU for a similar postion at another University so don't email him. Spoiler, you won't tour the entire steam tunnel system because that would take many hours and you would probably hate it after about 20 minutes. You will luckily be in a section that isn't super dirty and is tall enough to stand up in. If you do see monsters or ghosts, please report back.

***EDIT:*** I also wanted to add that there is no WiFi in the tunnels and the chances of getting a cell signal are extremely small (you're underground...) so if you needed to call for help, it would be very difficult.",8,130,0.99,10gbkam,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/10gbkam/steam_tunnel_info/

4582,Post,"###Welcome to 2021!

Hello everyone, and welcome back! Hopefully 2021 is a better year for you all than last year. We've all been through a lot, and I think it's safe to say that everyone is ready for things to be back to normal (fingers crossed for Fall 2021!) There's not really much new to share except a few key things, but just figured I'd keep everyone in the loop at what's going on with CyRide for this Spring. 

---
###Regular service resumes on Monday, 1/25/2021

Normal service will resume on Monday, 1/25, and Moonlight Express will resume on Friday, 1/29. Please keep in mind that we will still run a full break schedule for the week of the 18th, so the please keep the following in mind for next week:

* #21 Cardinal, #11 Cherry, #12 Lilac will not run until Monday, 1/25
* #23 Orange and #9 Plum will have reduced service until Monday, 1/25 *(other routes also have some reduced service, but the impact is minimal. Look for the shaded lines on the printed schedule - those do not run over breaks.)*
* #25 Gold will follow it's break schedule **and route** until Monday, 1/25.

---
###This one is important: #21 Cardinal and #23 Orange routes are back on regular route!

For nearly the past two years, #21 Cardinal and #23 Orange routes were on a detour due to the Gerdin Business Building expansion which resulted in the Wallace Road closure. Construction was completed right when ISU went on Winter Break. For some of you, you may only know the detour version of these routes. If you're not familiar with the correct routes, you may want to brush up. [Here](https://www.cyride.com/Home/ShowDocument?id=9451) is the map of Cardinal's regular route, and [Here](https://www.cyride.com/Home/ShowDocument?id=9435) is Orange's regular route. Please note that Cardinal no longer goes down Morrill road, and Orange no longer goes on Union Drive by the President's house.

---

### #3 Blue Route/South 5th Street

Blue route has also been impacted by construction for quite a while, resulting in the Blue route having to completely bypass South 5th Street. That construction was also completed over break, so we're back on route. However, due to the nature of the road construction, the South Meadows stop and shelter will be permanently closed. Riders that used to use the South Meadows stop will either need to catch the bus at the stops at River Birch or South Walnut.

---

###Moonlight Express

As stated above, MLX resumes on Friday, 1/29. If you're not up to date with the changes to Moonlight express, we've limited fixed-route service to the A Shuttle which services West Ames and East Ames at Duff on 20 minute timetable.

For all other areas, the E shuttle is available, which is basically a late night dial-a-ride. Give CyRide a call any time after 10:00pm (Fridays and Saturdays only) to schedule a pickup and a minibus will be dispatched to your location as soon as possible (including, but not limited to: Ontario Street, Somerset, Schilleter/University Village, Freddy Court, Towers, Research Park/Wessex, Copper Beach/The Grove, and South Duff.) For more information, [the Moonlight Express page](https://www.cyride.com/schedules/school-year-schedule/moonlight-express) on our website should give you the most up to date maps and timetables.

---
###CyRide in inclement weather conditions

With a winter snow storm approaching here in a couple of hours, I figured it would be appropriate to include this, especially because it appears that we're going to have a late winter. CyRide has historically almost never cancelled service due to severe weather conditions. I think there was one instance before my time where we cancelled for one day because the roads were a solid sheet of ice, but other than that we don't really cancel unless it's absolutely necessary for the safety of both drivers and passengers. While rare, it is possible that service is suspended until conditions improve like we've done in the past with flash floods.

**However,** when conditions are severe enough, you should expect late buses and/or missed trips. We will most likely not be guaranteeing transfers if buses start running late. Please keep this in mind if you're planning on riding, and try to catch an earlier bus if you have an appointment. 

The best way you can stay up to date is by following our website, Facebook, and Twitter accounts. We will generally update them if any changes to service occur due to weather disruptions.

---

###Obligatory COVID update

Though nothing has really changed with our policy, I still feel that it's important to share. Our mask policy has not changed, our drivers are still disinfecting the buses with a peroxide solution when they have down time, and our laneworkers are still completely spraying down the buses at the end of service. When the weather gets a bit nicer, we'll start opening the windows and roof hatches to maximize fresh airflow through the buses.

---

###TL;DR

**TL;DR:** Regular service resumes on Monday, 1/25. During the week of 1/18 be aware of changed service to some routes due to break schedule. Wallace Road is open; #21 and #23 are back on regular route. South Meadows stop closed on Blue Route on South 5th Street. Moonlight express starts 1/29, call if you need a ride if you're outside the A shuttle service zone. For inclement weather, CyRide will most likely still run, but buses might be late. Finally, COVID policy is the same as last year.

4585,Post,"Four years ago convos had espresso machines, there were 3 sides per meal bundle, there were no such things as ‚Äúflex‚Äù meals, a meal swipe was a meal swipe. 

The next year they removed the espresso machines from convos, made meal bundles jump down to 2 sides per meal.

The next year they introduced flex meals - 35 per semester and the unlimited plans, while raising the prices of all the meal plans.

This year they lowered the amount of express meals, removed caribou, destroyed froots selection and renaming it ‚Äúwhirlybirds‚Äù, and lowered the amount of flex meals yet again, while introducing a cyflex plan for those who relied on flex meals.

Meal plans were pretty simple, a swipe was a swipe anywhere.  If you wanted to buy something that was a bundle, you‚Äôd use your dining dollars.

Now there‚Äôs a lot of confusion, swiping in a friend subtracts from your dining dollars, limited flex meals, less amounts of food from bundles, and more.

So how does ISU lose money from this?  There are many meals that are left over from the fold plans at end of semesters.

It kind of feels like a huge scam, and there‚Äôs not really anything the student body can do?",42,149,0.99,9rbsyq,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/9rbsyq/how_can_isu_dining_every_year_cut_out_more_and/

First of all, welcome (back?) to Iowa State University! I'm sure the University is glad to have you here, and I'm happy you're here too.

I think one of the most beneficial things as a new student is to actually **know** what resources and services Iowa State has to offer to its students. Most of these are free, but a couple have **slight** costs (I'll try to label these).

Let me follow up with this: *This post is* ***not*** *an exhaustive list of resources and services, but I think they tend to be the most helpful for new students*. That being said, there are **tons** of resources that won't be covered in this post. Many of them are available here: [https://cyclonesupport.iastate.edu/support-resources](https://cyclonesupport.iastate.edu/support-resources)

Also a disclaimer: Because I don't want to get sued or something, I should say that this post is **not** sponsored or approved by Iowa State, and while I went to great effort to ensure the information is correct, it could be incorrect. It also is not medical or legal advice.

I think that the traditional style res halls are better than suites. Suites tend to be less social so going with the traditional style can help with making friends and meeting people.

AC isn‚Äôt important, imo. People have lived in the dorms without it for many years and been fine. The dens/rec rooms/certain common spaces have AC so you can always go there. It only gets super hot for a couple weeks.

Introduction

Iowa State University is a world-class institution, known for its excellent academic programs, vibrant campus community, and beautiful campus. However, one area where ISU could improve is in the availability of dining options for students. Currently, the campus dining centers are located in various buildings, making it difficult for students to access them quickly and easily.

To address this issue, we propose the addition of a new dining center on top of the Campanile, called the Camp-a-Meal. The Campanile is a well-known and iconic landmark on the ISU campus, and its central location would make it an ideal location for a dining center. The Camp-a-Meal would provide students with a convenient, unique, and appealing dining option, while also enhancing the use and visibility of the Campanile.

Background

The Campanile is a 277-foot tall bell tower that is located in the heart of the ISU campus. Built in 1912, the Campanile is one of the oldest and most recognized buildings on campus. It currently serves as a carillon and is open to the public for tours.

The Campanile has a spacious observation deck on its top level, offering panoramic views of the campus and surrounding area. However, this space is currently underutilized, with only a few benches and a small museum exhibit.

Adding the Camp-a-Meal dining center to the top of the Campanile would provide a unique and appealing dining option for students, while also enhancing the use and visibility of the Campanile. The Camp-a-Meal would offer a variety of food options, including healthy and sustainable options, to cater to the diverse tastes of ISU students.",8,32,0.92,zjc8yf,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/zjc8yf/asked_chatgpt_to_write_a_proposal_for_the/

The true number is probably closer to 200 million people considering 1 dose of a vaccine is not 1 vaccination. There are less than 350 million people in the US. Still a small figure though.

The good things have mostly been mentioned already I think, open note asynchronous exams are great, early postings of assignments and notes when possible, recording any synchronous lectures to allow for rewatching, lab classes optionally online or in person. For my classes at least the lectures have been standard length or occasionally going a few minutes over due to questions.

The things I really dislike are the quizzes or exams during class where we're required to have a webcam on and then rush to get anything submitted before the class time ends. Another issue is that it seems like every class uses a different program for video lectures so I'm constantly switching between them and dealing with the issues of each.

I don‚Äôt know how good your high school lunch is but mine was pretty good, and I‚Äôd say the dining halls here are miles better. I think it‚Äôs best to start with the cardinal plan, and then you reevaluate how much you like the dining halls for second semester. If you just want more flex meals, then the cyclone plan might be a good option. The cardinal plan, though, is more than enough for most people. 

Overall, I like the dining halls a lot, considering it‚Äôs incredibly easy to grab something quick and head to class.

4741,Post,"*This is not an official ISU statement.  I am not posting on behalf of ISU.  Read all disclaimers before operating this machinery.  Closed course; professional driver.  Do not make eye contact with geese.*

Good morning, Cyclones.  Most of the weather discussions on this sub revolve around tornados or the six months of cryogenic experiments, treacherous polar ice, and crushing seasonal depression that native Iowans quaintly call ""winter.""  However, I'm posting today to talk about the eyeball-melting heat that we're going to experience through most of the next week.

**What bad?**

Starting today and continuing through most of the first week of classes, we're going to see temperatures in the 90s, with heat indices (the perceived temperature) in above 100¬∫ in the afternoons.  If you're engaged in outdoor work or recreation, these are temperatures that can overwhelm your body's ability to stay cool, resulting in heat illnesses that are not a great way to start the semester.

**What do?**

* Stay hydrated - even if you aren't thirsty
* Dress appropriately - loose, lightweight, light colors
* Hydrate
* Sunscreen
* Hydrate
* Do not leave pets, children, or roommates alone in a closed vehicle
* Hydrate

**Heat sucks.  Where go?**

If you need to cool off, go indoors.  If you're seeking air-conditioned comfort, go to [the interactive campus map](https://www.fpm.iastate.edu/maps/) and click on a building to see its hours of operation.  All of ISU's major academic buildings, as well as those with common/social spaces, have air conditioning.

If a shopping cathedral born of '80s design trends is more your aesthetic, North Grand Mall is your best local option.  Other major retail areas are Main Street downtown; Duff Avenue between US30 and Main Street; and, of course, the Campustown area just south of campus.  All of these are accessible via CyRide - whose buses are also air-conditioned.

**Not feeling so good...**

Be mindful of what your body is telling you and keep an eye on the people around you.  Heat exhaustion can ruin your day.  If unchecked, it can escalate to heat stroke, which can put you in the hospital.  Very awkward.

Heat exhaustion signs/symptoms:

* Heavy perspiration
* Cold, clammy, pale skin
* Nausea, dizziness, vomiting

Heat exhaustion help - cool down:

* Move to a cool indoor area
* Hydrate

Heat stroke signs:

* Not sweating any more
* Hot, red, dry skin
* More nausea, dizziness, and vomiting
* Altered mental status, loss of consciousness

Heat stroke help:

* This is a medical emergency - call 911 *and know where you are so you can tell help where to go*

**Too hot; didn't read.**

Very hot.  Much hydrate.  So AC.",4,92,0.98,15vdy86,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/15vdy86/extreme_heat_today_into_next_week_stay_cool_and/

After that it is on 20 minute service until around 10pm and then 40 minute service until 1am.  The only difference will be that you have to board the bus on the other side of the street at Lincoln and Union to go back to your original location.

4764,Post,"Hello, Cyclone fans. Let me first introduce myself. My name is Jon, and I am a Morgantown native. I graduated WVU in computer and electrical engineering in 2008,  and currently work locally for an engineering company. I was a former tour guide at WVU, and my friends and I travel near and far for WVU games. Sadly, I won't be making it to an away games this year, but I'd like to make your visit a bit more enjoyable now that we are BigXII brothers & sisters.

**Gameday Parking**

WVU and private businesses all around the stadium sell tailgating spots. Some are more strict than others. Almost all the of lots adjacent to the stadium are for season parking permit holders. Parking cost range anywhere from $15-$40. All WVU lots are open 7am. You may put up a tent adjacent to your parking space in WVU lots. If you have access to grass area, you are typically allowed to use that too. If you're parking at a business, most will allow you to buy a space next to you if you want to put up an additional tent. 

Most do not allow kegs because of problems with fraternities trashing lots. WVU lots do not allow drinking games like flip cup and beer pong. Corn hole is OK. In WVU lots, keep liquor out of sight and in a plastic cup. 

If you are parking an RV, you can park at the WVU Coliseum for $80 starting 8am Friday.

Free parking is available in lots adjacent to the Coliseum. Or if you get there early enough, you can park off of 705 without penalty on game day.

* More info here http://www.wvusports.com/page.cfm?section=9610

* Maps of WVU campus http://transportation.wvu.edu/maps

You are allowed to tailgate past kickoff time. However, once you leave the stadium you will not be permitted to re-enter. WVU now sells beer inside the stadium. They range from $7 to $9. If you're into craft beer, they do sell beer locally brewed by [Morgantown Brewing Company](http://www.morgantownbrewing.com).

**Alcohol Laws**

No open containers, although much of it ends up in a grey area on game day. Don't walk with open containers on sidewalks, city property, roads, etc. Keep everything in the parking lot of where you're tailgating, and you'll be fine. If you're walking to or from tailgates (sidewalks etc) keep it covered. Most cops are too busy to worry about someone carrying an upopened beer can even if it's technically illegal. Just keep everything in a cooler or bag. 

Beer & wine sales start at 7am and stop selling at 2am. Liquor sales start at 8am and stop at 12 midnight. On Sundays you cannot buy alcohol until 1pm. Sales/consumption at bars cease at 3am and is when most bars downtown close.

Beer & wine is available at all grocery stores in Morgantown. Beer is available at most gas stations and convience stores. Liquor is only available in a few stores in Morgantown due to liquor licenses.

**Liquor Store Locations**

*Off I-79*

* Giant Eagle - 4500 University Towne Centre Dr. Granville, WV (if you can't find it on maps, try Morgantown in place of Granville - 9am to 9pm)

*Off I-68*

* BFS (gas station) - 204 Venture Dr. Morgantown, WV 26508 (Glenmark Center)

* Giant Eagle - Green Bag Rd. Morgantown, WV 26501 (they stop selling liquor at 9pm)

*In town*

* Ashbrooke Liquor Outlet - 300 Beechurst Ave. Morgantown, WV 26505 (center of Morgantown, most popular)

* BFS Liquor - I can't find an address, but it's next to the Post Office downtown at the end of High St.

**Tobacco**

WVU is a smoke free campus as of July 1, 2013. There is no indoor smoking in any business in Monongalia County. Most businesses do have an area outside that allow smoking. Electronic cigarettes are generally OK to use.

**Avoiding Fan harassment pre/post game**

Unfortunately it does happen from time to time. Avoid massive tailgates that seem to be out of control and populated by young students. You'll only find these in private lots, and they've generally been stomped out, though it's worth at least mentioning as a precaution. Stick to areas that boarder WVU property if it's a real concern. Overall, you should be fine.

**Note:**
*If WVU happens to come out on top, I recommend staying til the end of the game. It's a tradition for the entire stadium to sing [John Denver's Country Roads](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au0akngU1dg) after a home game win. Being a part of that alone is an amazing experience I think any college football fan can appreciate.*

**Recommended Local food**

*Downtown*

* Casa Di' Amici - NY style pizza

**Tips for surviving downtown/nightlife**

Taxi's are a PITA in Morgantown because of a stupid law that causes a monopoly. However, it's not worth ruling out. In the evening, there is a taxi stand outside of Bent Willy's you can hop in line to wait for a cab ride home.

http://www.dubvsaferide.com/ is a newer option that seems to be doing pretty well.

http://www.busride.org/ local bus

Parking is a headache. WVU lots that are not marked 24 hour restricted in the downtown area is free to park in overnight. City parking is pay 24/7. Do not park anywhere else. You will get towed even if it was not marked.

A few notes I want to make after reading fan experiences in Morgantown. If you call the cab company and no one answers several times, it's probably because they've turned off their phone. Don't bother. The PRT closes at 10:15pm on Fri evening and 5:00pm (typical) on Sat evening. However, for games, these hours are extended. If you find yourself stranded in ""Evansdale"" side of town and want to make it downtown, make your way over to Towers (student residential complex). There, you can take the ""drunk bus"" downtown with the other students. TBH your best bet is to ask someone local nicely for a ride or have your hotel take you.

___

**Downtown drunk food**

* Bent Willy's Pizza

* Casa Di' Amici

* DP Dough

* Hotdog man (cart)

* Pita Pitt

* Subway

* Tailpipes

* Jimmy Johns

* Morgantown Tacos (Food Truck)

* Jersey Subs (Food Truck - only sometimes makes appearances)

* Tudors Biscuits

* Birdman's Hotdogs (cart)

**Note: Recent controversial city laws may ban food trucks/carts, so you may not see them around.**

I think that about covers it. Hopefully, I didn't miss anything. Feel free to join us over in /r/wvu. And if you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them. If nothing else, I'd like to invite you all to our tailgate. We tailgate right next to the stadium in the Blue Lot.  Just PM me, and I'll let you know where we'll be tailgating. Good luck this season!

Additional note, this game is obviously when students will be gone. Attendance will be low and downtown life will calmer than usual.",8,13,0.76,1r4xs2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/1r4xs2/greetings_from_morgantown_plan_to_visit_wvu_next/

4788,Comment,"I lived in Helser. Welcome to ISU!

Meal Plans - you have to have one. Get the smallest available, trust me you will probably have plenty and if not can buy more. There is a certain time frame to switch meal plans so keep an eye on that but start with the smallest. iirc meals expire at the semester and dining dollars expire at the year. Dining dollars buy you stuff in the convenience store and other places around campus so if you still have some left at the end of the semester you can buy non perishable foods or the non food items (staples and ibuprofen and stuff like that.)

The 2 main dining centers are in the UDCC (big building right there, can't miss it. you will also get mail and packages here). First is the one upstairs (Union Drive Marketplace) I was never much of an early riser so I didn't have breakfast often but a selection of donuts, eggs, pancakes, waffles (make your own any time of day), and other breakfasty stuff was all okay. They have different stations with different foods. you can check out the website to see whats one the menu for each of the different places. http://www.dining.iastate.edu/menus
In general I thought their food was run through a ""de-flavorizer"". The pizza can often be undercooked and they managed to ruin pancakes for me once. PANCAKES. thats some skill right there (or severe lack of) but for the most part it was a solid OK to MEH. They do have a soft serve ice cream/fro yo thing so beware the Freshman 15. 

Second up is Clyde's. I prefered to eat there. You can order online (idr the website, look for it when you walk in or ask) to avoid the line. Godfather's pizza and overall food quality is slightly better, if not the choice of a buffet. You get entree, drink, and 2? sides. Often I saved a side or two in my mini fridge for the days you don't want to leave the building for food and was still satisfied. 

When it comes down to it dorms and meal bundles are way expensive. I paid something like $7,000 or so my freshman year on just housing and food. Break down your meal bundle to the price per meal, its probably upwards of $6-7 a meal. That's almost restaurant prices. How many of those meals are spent on a single bowl of cereal? Right now I live in UV, and pay $2700 a year for apt with all utilities paid (dated and has its problems but by fair best price you can get in ames) except gas. I'm not great about marking exactly what I spend on what but I guarantee I haven't spent even close to $4300 on food. Hell I'd be surprised if it was greater than $1500. That's almost three grand in savings right there. I don't have to get dressed and leave my space if I want to go get food. I can eat on my hours, not only when dining center is open, and have what I want made how I like it. I have my own bedroom and we have a full kitchen and living room. We have a fenced in patio (abiet not huge). Dorms are great for your first year, but sophomore year you should definitely look into UV or other options. 

Sorry for the long post. I'l be happy to answer any questions

4808,Post,"Hello, my name is ShatteR and I just wanted to make a quick post about competitive video games offered at Iowa State. I am currently playing on the Rainbow Six Siege team, playing against other colleges in and out of the US (online of course).I had difficulty locating a place to find other people playing the game. I am making this post to hopefully raise awareness about this game, and others. 

Our first season just ended, and we are in the process of reorganizing teams and making sure the best people are on the right teams. I wanted to make this post to make sure that everyone that is interested in playing this game (or others) has the knowledge that there is something out there for them, and you might be the perfect fit for the team. The teams are all run through the Game Renegades Club and Discord: https://discord.gg/kNuSg2u 

If you are looking to play Rainbow Six, League of Legends, Overwatch, CS:GO, or any other game at a competitive or casual level, this is the discord for you!

Please feel free to message me on Reddit pms, or one of the admins in the GR discord for any information you have about the club or joining a team! Thanks for reading.



P.S.
If you are reading this long after the post was made, I'm sure the information will still be relevant unless Discord goes under and all is lost.

This is all good, but I want to commend this part in particular.  I was in another conversation yesterday regarding academic dishonesty in online classes and the faculty freakouts around it (/u/Hornetpride, I will admit your comment in the other thread was on my mind).

I did my entire master's degree online.  The program was designed for working professionals and was complete asynchronous.  Every exam was open note/book, non-timed, and open for several days to accommodate students' schedules.  Our answers were run through a plagiarism checker, but otherwise I felt like the intent was to grade us on synthesizing and analyzing information, not our capacity for timed regurgitation.  

Every time I see a post about lockdown browsers and webcam-monitored exams, a part of my soul dies.  I hate the conceit that we have to turn exams into another facet of a surveillance state.

Back for more!

Recent news from the CDC and the Iowa Department of Public Health has generated a lot of interest in the status of COVID-19 vaccination in the ISU campus community.  *This is not an official ISU statement* (as always, see my flair if you're confused) but I wanted to bring my three loyal readers up to speed on what's happened since [my last post on this subject](https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/kwoo0p/covid_vaccination_update_13_jan_2021/).  Also, *I am not a healthcare professional*, so I may get some details wrong.

This post assumes you've already read my previous post, linked above.  I'm not going to review a lot of that material here.

This is going to be a long post with very little that can be condensed to a meaningful TL;DR.  Please bear with me.  I'll try to break up the major topics for readability.

*****

**Vaccine Development and Approval**

The big news here is that on February 27, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine (otherwise known as the Janssen vaccine - Janssen Biotech is a division of big J&J).  This is significant for a couple of reasons.  First, it opens up additional manufacturing capability.  Second, the Johnson & Johnson formulation is a single-dose vaccine, whereas the existing Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses (""prime,"" or first, and ""boost,"" or second).

That single-dose capability is huge from a logistics perspective.  Scheduling, supply, and staffing have all been major headaches for the organizations across the country that are administering the two-dose vaccines.  Once the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is available in quantity, mass vaccinations will accelerate.

*****

**Vaccine Distribution**

Some of you may have seen me post a shorter version of this explanation over the weekend, but here's a deeper dive into how vaccine is getting from the manufacturers to people's arms.

In the United States, distribution is centrally controlled by the CDC.  For Moderna, the CDC has a distribution contract with McKesson, a company which previously gained experience in nationwide vaccine distribution during the H1N1 influenza pandemic (2009-2010).  Moderna ships to McKesson; McKesson then distributes vaccine to state, territorial, and tribal public health agencies according to CDC guidance.  In Iowa's case, the Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) receives the shipments that are destined for our state.  Pfizer looks similar except for the first step - Pfizer ships directly to the state/territorial/tribal agencies rather than letting McKesson handle shipping.

When IDPH receives a vaccine shipment, it then distributes that among all 99 of Iowa's counties, as well as pharmacies in the state that are authorized to dispense vaccine.  At the county level, the local public health agency receives the county allocation.  Depending on county-level capabilities, it then administers the vaccine itself or hands it off to local partners to administer.

In Story County - the county in which ISU is located, for those who aren't sure - our local public health agency is Story County Public Health (SCPH).  When SCPH gets a vaccine drop from the state, they administer some of it themselves.  So far, the rest has been divided among school districts, long-term care facilities (i.e., nursing homes), hospitals (Mary Greeley Medical Center and Story County Medical Center, healthcare clinics (e.g., McFarland), and ISU.

I'm not sure what criteria are being used to guide distribution at any of those levels.  Might be census data (this is why filling out your census forms is important), might be tarot cards.

*****

**Vaccine Numbers**

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has [a page with a bunch of links to CDC data on nationwide distribution numbers](https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccines/distribution/index.html).  If you want to crunch those, go there.

In Story County, numbers vary week by week, but we are generally seeing about 1,000 doses per week.  That's combined Pfizer and Moderna, and given the need to administer two doses per patient, that was a net 500 full vaccinations per week.  IDPH recently bumped that up to about 1,250.

Per [IDPH's COVID-19 vaccination status page](https://coronavirus.iowa.gov/pages/vaccineinformation), Story County has fully vaccinated 7,448 people and another 8,017 people have received their prime doses.  We have an estimated 98,000 residents here, including ISU students, so... that ain't a great percentage today.  In the next section, I'll break down who those 15,465 people are.

*****

**Vaccine Prioritization**

This is where it gets fun.  And by ""gets fun,"" I mean ""makes everyone cranky and anxious.""

One of the defining characteristics of a disaster is that the need for resources outstrips the resources that are available to deal with the incident.  This is certainly the case when it comes to COVID vaccine supplies today.  In such situations, the people who own the problem have to start making hard decisions about where those resources will go to have the greatest impact.

The CDC runs a group called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).  ACIP is in charge of making recommendations on how to prioritize COVID-19 vaccine allocation.  CDC passes those recommendations down to state public health agencies, which then have the authority to modify them based on state-level demographics and other factors.  This is important because it's the states, not the federal government, that have the authority to enforce vaccine prioritization under law.  Also, this creates confusion when people see that one state is doing things differently from another state.

In Iowa, IDPH has tweaked its prioritization a couple of times.  The top priority, which is where vaccines started in December, was Phase 1A.  That was healthcare workers (to protect the people who are keeping the rest of us from dying) and long-term care facilities' residents and staff (to protect the largest highest-risk demographic).

Phase 1B, which is where we are now, included a bunch more professional groups.  Because Iowa wasn't getting enough vaccine to take care of all of 1B at once, IDPH subdivided 1B into five tiers.  The info in the following bullet points is copied and pasted from IDPH's site because I want to be sure I'm using their terminology: 

* Tier 1:  First Responders; PK-12 staff, early childhood education, childcare workers

* Tier 2: Frontline essential workers in food, agriculture, distribution, and manufacturing sectors who live or work in non-social distanced settings; Individuals with disabilities living in home settings and their direct care staff

* Tier 3: Staff and individuals living in congregate settings not covered by previous Phase or Tier; Government officials, including staff, engaged in business at the State Capitol

* Tier 4: Inspectors responsible for health, life and safety

* Tier 5: Correctional facility staff and individuals incarcerated

Additionally, Phase 1B includes all persons age 65 and older.  In Story County, McFarland Clinic is doing the heavy lifting there.  They've been working their way through an age-prioritized list of everyone in their patient database.  They started with a 109-year-old and are currently down to the 76-year-olds.  Scroll down a bit [on this page](https://www.mcfarlandclinic.com/coronavirus/covid-19-vaccine) to see an infographic with their current status.

Now I want to point out a few things about the tiers.  First, under 1B Tier 2, the ""essential workers..."" part of that is basically targeting workers in the meatpacking industry who live in bunkhouse-type settings.  Remember the big outbreaks in those plants last spring/summer when everyone was terrified of a bacon shortage?  Yeah.  [That's where Iowa's initial allocation of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine is going right now](https://idph.iowa.gov/News/ArtMID/646/ArticleID/158404/Over-100000-Doses-of-Vaccine-Arrive-In-Iowa-This-Week).

Second, IDPH has specifically stated that students in university residence halls are *not* part of Tier 3's ""congregate settings"" clause.  Some other states are doing that differently.

Third, IDPH has explicitly stated that college/university faculty are *not* part of the educators in Tier 1.  Again, some other states are doing that differently.

Last week, IDPH expanded the definition of Phase 1B to *also* include - the quoted text is their own words again - ""Persons age ~~26~~ **16** to 64 years that are or might be at an increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19 due to medical conditions listed at at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html""  So there's that, ~~but the lower limit on the age range means the majority of our students are still not eligible to be vaccinated~~.

**Update:** After some digging, it looks like the 26 on IDPH's site, as quoted above, is a typo.  Other IDPH briefing documents say the correct lower age limit for this category is **16**, as flagged by /u/MrRoundJr.

*****

**What Is ISU Doing?**

As I mentioned in the section on distribution, ISU gets a portion of Story County's allocation from SCPH.  Once it gets here, Thielen Student Health Center (TSHC) is in charge of getting it into arms, with support from the team here in the Emergency Operations Center (EOC).

In accordance with IDPH's prioritization phases and tiers, TSHC has been vaccinating ISU employees who fall into 1A and 1B as a result of their jobs.  They've also vaccinated the staff of the three childcare centers associated with ISU, who are not ISU employees but are closely affiliated with the university, and have administered it to a small number of other ISU employees in the 65+ age range.  They've been at the forefront of the university's COVID fight [since before COVID Day One](https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/l6czof/dispatches_from_the_eoc_covid_new_year/) and will be there until we're done with mass vaccinations.  As long as we keep receiving vaccine, they'll continue vaccinating members of the campus community according to the state's prioritization system.

*****

**What's Next?**

In the words of Facebook, ""it's complicated.""

You can see from the numbers above that Iowa and Story County still have a long way to go, and if we assume the current supply levels continue, it's gonna take a while.  On the other hand, President Biden also recently stated that by the end of May, vaccine will be available to everyone in the U.S. who wants it.  That may be just a politician's promise, but it may be an indicator that additional federal resources (including the [Defense Production Act](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2021/03/02/biden-administration-announces-historic-manufacturing-collaboration-between-merck-johnson-johnson-expand-production-covid-19-vaccines.html)) are being mobilized to hasten the production and distribution processes.  I can't say for sure.

It's not my place to go into too much detail on our plans here.  We have official ISU spokespeople for that.  I think I can safely say that we're looking at a range of possibilities from ""the current trickle continues"" to ""Uncle Joe opens the magic faucet and vaccine flows like water"" and figuring out what resources we'll need to administer each level of that.

The biggest unknown remains timing.  We don't have good visibility into where production is going at a national level or how many doses Iowa or Story County will receive two weeks from today.  Without that, it's impossible to predict when we'll able to go full-throttle ourselves.

I know everyone wants hard answers and a definite date for their own vaccination appointment , but none of us are in a position to give you those today.  Hopefully, the information I've provided and linked in this post will give some readers a better understanding of where we are today and where we're headed in the coming months.  If you've made it this far - thanks for reading, thanks for hanging in there, stay strong, stay masked, and promise me you'll hug a custodian and a TSHC employee when this is over.",45,105,0.99,m0pv9f,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/m0pv9f/dispatches_from_the_eoc_march_vaccine_update/

4886,Comment,"I think some thought needs to be taken as to the audio and video. I work particularly hard nowadays to make sure that my house is completely quiet and the lighting is adequate (still not as good as I would like!). If you have bad audio, forget it, no one will watch.

But once you make it watchable, the other thing is to be a bit human. Don't deliver things in a monotone voice. Be excited when you think things are exciting, let your joy come through and people will pick up on it. Also be genuine, if you pretend to be excited it is not the same.

One thing that you often hear people say is ""there is no single right way to teach"", and by that we mean that my style of teaching is very different from say Kris Lee or from Victoria Blumen, but we are all good teachers. We each find the way that works for us, and you should think about what works for you. I should add a warning that some people might take the preceding phrase as to mean ""there is no wrong way to teach"", which is clearly false, there are LOTS of bad teachers.

One more comment, make sure you understand things. On a deep level, down to the smallest detail where you could explain something at the drop of a hat if anyone asked. And not only understand things but be ready to *share it in a way that you would want to hear it* (I sometimes tell people I have one student in mind when I am teaching, and that is me; thankfully it turns out that a lot of people are like me and so they also get something out of it). As Einstein would say ""make things as simple as possible, but not simpler""

I find that many people have for too long overly complicated ideas or put too many layers on rules and procedures so that we forget that the underlying ideas are pretty beautiful.

I had a fairly promising phone interview the other day where it seemed like the job was doing the exact same thing as I was doing with CySat, just scaled up to New Glenn scale. Fingers crossed.

My primary responsibilities with CySat were to take all the stuff that previous teams had purchased and make them all talk nicely with each other, to program the ground station software, and to integrate the radiometer (software, power, communication, everything but structure) (the radiometer had been changed very late in the process) with the rest of the satellite. All three made me tear my hair out and I could probably write a book about all of the stupid problems I ran into.

I definitely lost sleep over the NG-21 issues. But it is so surreal knowing that it is up there at last.

And when I say ridiculously loud I mean it's actually ridiculous, there's no reason it should be as loud as it is. I used to ride motorcycles and my dad and brother ride motorcycles and none of ours were ever that loud. motorcycles are naturally loud, but that one is louder than it should be. The noise shouldn't be loud enough that it wakes me up from a dead sleep from across the street with my window closed to the point where I have to cover my ears because it physically hurts. There's also lots of idiots that go outside around midnight and start yelling and screaming and it's so obnoxious. The apartment is really nice and the leasing company itself is fantastic, but the assholes who live in the area really ruin it. I really enjoy not having a pet fee or pet rent and the fact that maintenance is so quick to respond and when applying I didn't have to provide proof of income, previous rental history, or anything but I agree it's not worth it with the amount of noise and idiots around here. I can't recall a single quiet night around here, it's literally every single night people are outside screaming and if it's not people screaming it's the motorcycle at 6am or 1am or some ridiculous time. Also on the topic of upstairs neighbors, mine constantly sounded like they were rearranging their entire apartment and always at the worst times. Like I could hear loud thumping and dragging across the floor from 11pm to 6am. I don't know what they were doing up there, but there was a note on the door a while ago stating that police were going to be entering or something like that.

4947,Post,"Hi, everyone!

Last semester I asked on here for the locations of dead birds on campus. Kind of morbid and gross, but it was for a good reason!


I wanted to update you guys on it! I received a grant from the Iowa Ornithologists' Union to do a formal study this fall! Without your contribution of information, I probably wouldn't have proceeded with the project.


Here's what it is, and why it's important:

Every year, millions of birds die from window collisions, especially during large migration events in the spring and fall. There are two reasons why this happens: nocturnal migrants are attracted to light, so anything that produces light at night can cause them to crash into things, and during the day, the birds only see the reflections in the windows which makes them perceive it as more habitat.

When this happens, birds can concuss and die directly from those injuries, or are at a higher risk of predation (because they aren't moving and are not alert).

College campuses all over the US are magnets for bird-window collisions: we have large windows, a lot of landscaping close to those windows, and we have lights on at night.

I'm wanting a closer look at window-collision mortality on our very own campus. A student from the [University of Iowa](https://dailyiowan.com/2018/12/04/ui-student-research-found-over-100-birds-collided-into-5-campus-buildings-in-10-weeks/) did a similar study this past fall, and the Ornithology Club at Ohio State University has an ongoing study as well.

The immediate benefit of this study is the removal of bird carcasses from my study sites (TBD). Specimens in nice condition will be donated to the university so that they can be prepared for future animal-oriented classes (many of our current bird specimens are almost 100 years old!). Other specimens will be moved to another location to hopefully discourage scavengers from being on campus (which could potentially put my data and their lives in risk).

The other benefit of carcass removal is that you and prospective student tour groups don't have to look at them!

That was probably more information than anyone here cares about, but I am very excited about investigating this topic and wanted to share that excitement with you folks <3

4992,Post,"Hi everyone,

I'm your resident bird person! I've been attempting to record the locations of where birds have been hitting windows on campus, along with identifying the species/age/sex of the birds and potentially donating them to the university so they can be used for educational purposes (note: this requires a special permit. It's against the law to keep parts of migratory birds).

**If you find a dead bird on campus, please send me a PM that includes the location (building, which side of the building), and if you can, a close-up photo.**

COVID has made my collection process a lot more difficult, so I can't always get to the birds to get a photo myself. If you give me a photo and location, I can at least record it on an online database (which can be used to inform decisions about bird-safe design at the campus and potentially municipal level).

This information can be really important. Many things threaten bird populations, like habitat degradation, insecticides, and outdoor cats, and window collisions are no exception. We usually see a large increase of window collisions during migration, which happens from March-May and again August-October. The fall migration is usually especially fatal for populations, because it's directly after the breeding season, and young birds are very susceptible to flying into glass. The City of Ames recently announced that we are the first town in Story County to be ""bird friendly,"" which is a wonderful step for conservation, but I do feel that the city and the ISU campus can be doing more to prevent window collisions (solutions do exist!).

Thanks for your time, everyone!

u/BlankeTheBard (she/her)

Edit: We're supposed to have millions upon millions of birds migrating over the state tonight. I'll probably be out tomorrow morning to see what the damages are.

Edit: I walked around the Design building, SIC, Parks, Bessey, and the Sukup Atrium this morning. I found three deceased Ovenbirds (a very cute species of warbler), and two alive but stunned birds (Nashville Warbler and Common Yellowthroat). I moved those two off the sidewalk and into some bushes. I do hope they recovered safely!

Edit: I'm honestly blown away by the number of reports I've been getting from y'all over reddit. I really appreciate it. I understand that the messaging feature on here doesn't have an 'attach photo' option. You'll either need to upload photos to imgur, or I can give you my contact information so you can send it another way.

They do this because lots of the money comes from indirect sources(FAFSA, GI Bill, external scholarships). Those should be paid by the middle of the semester usually.

You should contact student financial aide office if you are worried about paying the bill. There is a monthly payment plan you can enroll into. It is also not too late to file a FAFSA quickly.

#FAQ

#What does this mean?

The amount of karma (points) on your comment and Reddit account has decreased by one.

#Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Rudeness towards other Redditors,
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Spreading incorrect information,
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a /s.

#Am I banned from the Reddit?

No - not yet. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.

#I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

#How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct.

I know it's getting pretty late as far as finding a place for the fall semester goes, and it may be next to impossible to find a place like she wants, but here are her specifications: an apartment that she'd be living in a big group, not just her or one other person. A co-ed building would be preferred. She's fine with bathroom sharing, but she really wants a room to herself.
It sounds like she'd enjoy a single room in a dorm, but it'd be pretty late to snag one, especially as a first-year student here, and she's not very welcome to the idea of sharing a room with a stranger. So, she's leaning towards apartments. There's no one she knows out here to share a room/apartment with. We're both sort of clueless about all this, so any input would be awesome. Thanks, guys!

5062,Comment,"I graduated and really my only experience with the dining hall was 4.5 years ago, but this is how I believe it goes. My experience is with UDCC so I cant speak to seasons or the other centers. I believe with your meal plan you are allowed 1 or 2 deluxe meals. I think you just take your id up to the station county cuisine and they will ask you which meals of the day they are offering. Usually takes about 10-15min.

5064,Comment,"Acevedo, a 91 Supreme Court case, stands for this proposition: ""The police may search an automobile and the containers within it where they have probable cause to believe contraband or evidence is contained.""

So- if you have drugs in plain view in your car, cops could almost certainly enter and search.

There is much lower expectation of privacy when it comes to vehicles which justifies less constitutional protections versus search of a home / dorm room.

You asked about a parked car, which is an unusual situation- probably because most people are smart enough to put their weed in the trunk.  Much more common is searches after the vehicle has been stopped for some reason - there are a ton of in and outs here, but again, you have constitutional rights and should never, ever waive them (unless, of course, your car is clean.... Then proceed at your own risk). ",1,2,,1q2ty2,t1_cd95r8f,/r/iastate/comments/1q2ty2/another_friend_just_got_a_mip_charge_so_i_did_a/cd96lpx/

Welch Avenue Station is a quiet bar. You can talk with friends across the table without yelling. Pint night on Wednesdays, top shelf night on Thursdays. 

Outlaws for country music and dancing. 

Old Main for beer brewed in Ames (or torrent). 

Mikey's is pretty fun. Not super loud and includes a patio. 

Cy's Roost had patio games (bags and another I don't know the name of). 

Es Tas has taco Tuesday. Tacos are around 1.10 each and are super greasy and delicious. Not sure how busy it is during the summer, but they often pack the bar for a few hours during the school year. Holds 100-150. 

AJ's is by far the largest. I have only been there a couple times, and it wasn't my cup of tea. Others may be able to share opinions and experiences though.

5117,Post,"Today, I learned the importance of never giving up. I remember leaving last semester knowing I had done poorly and I remember crying when I saw my GPA for that semester, sitting at approximately 0.7. I cussed myself out in the car that night, while I drove around. I have a distinct memory of driving over a bridge and wanting to stop my car, get out, and just throw myself off. I told myself that night that I would never succeed, I would never be as smart as the people surrounding me, and I would never make it in this world. I almost dropped out multiple different times last semester, thinking to myself, ‚ÄúIf I give up now, I can cut my losses for later.‚Äù

I went in to second semester not expecting much to change. I was still upset with how first semester had gone. I was still upset with my GPA. I was still upset with how my life was crumbling around me. But I had a little bit of hope: a new beginning. A new major. It was hard being able to motivate myself, since I was still stuck in that mindset that I would never succeed, but I tried regardless. I didn‚Äôt want my first year at ISU to also be my last. I didn‚Äôt want to spend the rest of my life working at the McDonalds by my house, which I knew would most likely be what I would do had I dropped out. I worked hard this semester, trying my hardest in everything I did academically and socially. I made a lot of new friends and I excelled in my classes. I made the decision that I wasn‚Äôt going to let a bad semester stand in the way of me and my success. There were times when it was hard. In those moments I looked at the future, rather than the past. I realized that there were so many wonderful people here, when I previously thought that the opposite was true. As much as I wanted to, I didn‚Äôt give up. 

The most important lessons aren‚Äôt always learned in a lecture hall, a recitation room, or a lab. Sometimes, they‚Äôre learned from yourself or the people around you.

So the moral of the story is this: don‚Äôt give up. Don‚Äôt hide from the world, but instead give it all you‚Äôve got. I let my 0.7 GPA from last semester control my thoughts and how I viewed myself, but now that 0.7 GPA will show where I came from and what I will become in the future. This isn‚Äôt an adventure I wanted to take, but now that I‚Äôve come this far, I realize how much it has changed me as a person. Thank you so much for accepting some random freshman into the ISU community. It truly means the world to me. Good luck on the rest of your finals and have a wonderful summer!

5121,Post,"I spent a lot of time my freshman year finding things in and around campus to explore! If you're a freshman or just an ISU student that's looking for new things to do, look no further! Here's my own list of everything I could think of to do. ^((This list includes no bars or 21+ activites))

# On Campus

* **The Memorial Union**

Home to many organizations I will list later, but the Memorial Union (or The MU for short) has events going on frequently, most set up by the Student Union Board. **Cyclone Cinema** plays *recentish* movies most days of the week, **Comedy Nights** where they bring in seasoned comediens, **ISU Afterdark** where they typically bring in a comedian and an actor to talk, along with other events and crafts all over the MU (which to be honest can be a hit or miss for me sometimes, check it out to see if you like anything they have going on!), **Cybowl & Billiards,** and other one-off events. Even if you aren't interested in the events, many of them are good opportunites to get free stuff.

*  **The Workspace**

Located in the Memorial Union, this is for the creatives! There is **Paint your own Pottery** almost every day with a rotating selection of things to paint. Good for custom gifts for family or friends. They occasionally have other crafts you can pay to make as well.

* **Maintenance Shop (M-Shop)**

Located in the Memorial Union, the M-shop is open during the day and is a good study spot, but it also hosts many events like **Grandma Mojo's Improv Comedy, Open Mic Night**, and most importantly-- **Live Music**! I can personally reccomend going to all of these, and I reccomend going to Open Mic Nights especially at the begining of each semester to get a good balance of comedy and musical acts. The tickets for live music and improv comedy are very inexpensive (*improv being only $1*) so keep an eye out for local bands performing!

* **Clubs and StuOrgs**

Many Clubs and StuOrgs will have events open to people who aren't members! If you're interested in art, the design college art club hosts events for things like **printmaking or pottery** for those with no experience. There's pretty much a club for everything you can think of, so look at the list online and check out those that interest you.

* **State Gym**

I'm not a big gym or sport person, so I have not much to say here. There's events for those who want to play sports in a group. There's also a **pool, hot tub, and a rock climbing area**, which I found fun!

* **The Center & The Multicultural Student Association**

Both Located in the Memorial Union and make for great study spots, and are also great for finding resources for LGBT and Multicultural students. Follow their social medias, as they both put on events frequently! Just off the top of my head they've done **Block Parties, Plushie making, Drag shows, Socials, Therapy Dogs** and **Self-Care packages.** (and a BTW if you're interested in dogs, Hamilton Hall has ""Press Paws"" which brings a therapy dog in almost every day!)

In the same vein, I reccomend checking out **The Sloss House** for resources and events for Women, LGBT Students, and Multicultural students. The environment is very welcoming and is a good study spot (or nap spot, if I'm being entirely honest)

* **Stephens Auditorium**

Has an event almost every month. Not technically through ISU, but they have larger events here like **Musicals, Music Performances** (Apparently Shrek the Musical is coming this year)**,** and occastionally some traveling tours will make their way here too. 

* **The Joan Bice Underwood Tea Room**

Serves lunch and fine dining at a more affordable price, because it's staffed by culinary students! Haven't been yet, but also want to go. 

* **ISU Dining**

The dining halls across campus will do themed nights, less of a thing to 'go do' but they will typically serve food they normally don't along with little prizes you can win so I always like to go. 

* **Student Innovation Center** 

The Student Innovation Center has workshops you can sign up for if you're interested in learning a new skill, like woodworking or even some things for content creators.

* **Residence Hall Events** 

If you're living on-campus, your res hall will undoubtely be hosting events for your building or your neighborhood. Go check them out, even if it's just for the free snacks.



Many other places on campus will also have events, check your e-mail and sign up for the **Iowa State Daily** for more events! Also, for freshman, reccomend going to many of the new student events. Even if you don't really care to socalize, I got more than enough plastic cups and tote bags to use for the entire year through the booths and such. Keep a lookout for posters on builitan boards for events from stuorgs and fellow students.

# Off Campus 

* **Reliable Street**

The home of Lockwood Cafe, a community garden, and also an Ames organization that puts on events like **Open Mic Nights**, **Punch Up Comedy, Poetry Slams,** **Local Markets, Live Music,** and **Art Instalations**. The environment is very accepting and is a nice place to get breakfast. 

* **Farmers Market**

Goes from May to October. Check out local produce.

* **Ice Skating**

When it starts to get cold, theres the Ames Ice Arena to go.

* **Trails and Outdoors**

While ISU campus has plenty to look at while walking around, off campus also has a lot of trails to check out!

* **Downtown Ames**

The shopping district. Downtown Ames has an online calander for community events as well. 

* **Reiman Gardens**

As an ISU student, you get access into Reiman for free! There's things to do all year long, from flowers to their butterfly garden to their Christmas light show. 

* **Geocaching**

An on and off-campus activity. If you're into escape rooms or enjoy mental puzzles then check out the geocaching website and try and solve all of them in town.

* **No Escape Iowa**

An escape room on Main street.

* **Time Out Arcade & Perfect Games**

It's an arcade! I haven't been before but it's something I want to check out this year. Perfect games also has **Bowling** and **Laser tag.**

* **Ames Ren Faire**

Happens towards the end of the school year. The Ames Ren Faire has only just started but this year there were lost of vendors and people in costume, if that's your thing.

* **Mayhem Comics**

A nerd store for those who like to play card games or dungeons and dragons. They have competition nights for **card games, board games**, and I believe also a **Dungeons and Dragons** night!

* **Dog Eared Books**

A welcoming bookstore. I hear they have **book clubs** for pretty much whatever you might be intersted in.

* **Clouds**

Admittedly, another thing that's less something to do and more of a place to study and eat. Clouds is something every student should go to at least once, as it provides a view of campus from like 8 stories above. It's very cool to see, and Clouds also has study competitions when it gets close to Finals Week.",5,28,0.92,1e7d2fq,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/1e7d2fq/list_of_things_to_do_in_amesisu/

5158,Comment,"I had a natural inclination to solving puzzles when I was a kid (both literal puzzles as well as brain teasers), and I eventually developed a knack for thinking mathematically, though it did not always come right away.

Fun fact:  Before I was born my parents were told that because of various complications of the pregnancy that I would likely have some challenges in life, and one which was particularly emphasized was that I would be bad at math.

Around high school my math mind kicked in and I just went for it.  So I went from being a ""C"" student as a Freshman in high school to being the star student in math as a Sophomore.

Actual fun fact:  As a sophomore I was in one of two trigonometry classes at my high school and for the final the teacher let the class do a ""group"" final.  For my class this meant I took the final and for the other class they actually all worked together.  One of the biggest shames I have is that I got two problems wrong on that final, and the other class got one wrong.  Damn it.

I will say that going out of high school it was still not entirely sure I would be a mathematician.  I was interested in programming and thought it would be cool to work in computer graphics and maybe do movies.  But I took a programming class (which back in the day meant Pascal) and found it incredibly boring, and at the same time I took a math class and found it was great and I was stoked that the young kid was able to keep up with his older counterparts.  (It is a shame that the programming class was not more fun; in retrospect I think it was a badly presented class and if they had made it more exciting or at least connected it directly to interesting problems I would probably be a computer scientist today.)

No great `aha!' moment, just a lot of gradual steps along the way.

I apologize if this is rambling a bit, it is one of the reasons I make a good calculus teacher, I keep going off on tangents!

On a side note when I say ""my math mind"" I mean the ability to take rules and definitions and understand and connect them together.  Often times in mathematics the problem is that people only vaguely know the rules and how to use them, it is once you see how everything fits together that you see the beauty that has gone into what we call mathematics.

Thankfully there weren‚Äôt many people there when I was, so my process may differ from people moving in later. Apologies in advance if there are any spelling/grammar errors in this, as I‚Äôm writing this up on my phone while waiting for food. 

When I arrived at Leid Rec center, I was greeted by some kind workers who told me to get my ID and Confirmation email ready. After entering the building, your temperature will get checked (mine was fine, so I don‚Äôt know what happens if you have a fever), then you will go and scan your ID and give your phone number for the testing kit label. I got super lucky and was able to check in with Wendy.

After finishing all the check-in process, you get taken to a hallway where a bunch of stations set up to get tested. The process was pretty quick; they stick the testing swab up your nose and spin it a few times - don‚Äôt know the exact number of rotations they do. It wasn‚Äôt painful but it felt like I was going sneeze and made my eyes watery. 

After having the test completed, you drop off the testing kit in a bin, then go and get your keys down the hall. When getting the keys to the room, they provided a temp parking pass for moving in, then they listed were to park until the parking passes get handed out. This was the last step to do before going through the exit path, which ISU Dining was set up giving out water bottles, cookies, or an apple.

5174,Comment,"1) I don't have a set favorite movie, but there are a few that I enjoy watching over and over.  Some recent examples include *Arrival* which I think is well put together and the way that the music and the action come together at the end is breath taking in a way.  Another example is *Your Name* which is an anime film which I must have watched at least a half-dozen times on Delta flights in the last few months, everything else was a boring movie, but *Your Name* just never seemed to get old and it felt more real than most movies.

2) Ice cream.  But I suppose the answer is it depends.  I think maybe if we had a red velvet cheesecake I would say yes to that.  But a well cooked cupcake with German chocolate frosting is hard for me to say no to.  (Oh and also carrot cake, I love a good carrot cake).

3) It has taken me a while to find good pens.  A few years ago I used sharpies, but they were not sharp enough.  Other faculty have used gel pens but they are too reflective.  Currently I am using Stabilo 68, I think they are a good combination of bright colors, non-reflective ink, and sharpness (though they dull after a while).  I like to use colors to help differentiate ideas, sometimes if its all uniform it is hard to pull out what is important, but I think it might also be safe to say I over-use color.  I haven't yet found the happy medium of using just enough to highlight only the most important parts).  At least I have a few decades left to master the art.

4) Thanks for your kind words; but remember the math was inside of you all I had to do was help you to find it.

As for arctan(), it is a function which has beautiful properties, a good derivative, a good Taylor series, is bounded, and so on.  Usually you only get one or two of these at a time.  I remember the first time I taught a course equivalent to what we call Calc 2 (this was about 15 years ago), it was during the summer and every Friday there was a test and I made it a personal challenge to always get arctangent on every test, and I think I succeeded.  Ever since then it has always been one of my favorites.",0,6,,71yh62,t1_dnei49x,/r/iastate/comments/71yh62/i_am_a_steve_butler_ask_me_anything/dneit1v/

Game Renegades CSGO is one of the fastest growing Counter-Strike programs in the country, and we want you to help us build the future of intercollegiate video games. Tryouts will be held throughout this upcoming week, starting tomorrow (Tuesday, 1/30/18). We recognize that this is very short notice, so we will be flexible with our scheduling for those who need it. Our priorities are teamwork, communication, and a drive to improve; be prepared for constructive criticism during the tryout, and a time commitment of 6-8 hours per week for team practices and matches throughout the season.

Those interested must fill out this form by the end of Thursday, 2/1/18 for a chance to try out:

5197,Post,"I live in SUV and been buying a mix of meal blocks and some dining dollars for the past few semesters which worked perfectly for a random lunch on campus and a few things from the C-Store here and there, but then started to really think about it. 



When using a meal for Froots, Hawthorne or Clyde's, you're actually loosing money every time. I used to buy a 50 meal block, which was roughly $10.50 a meal, but a typical bundle at Clyde's or Hawthorne is like $8-$9, so you're losing ~$2 every meal you use. When using a bundle for Froots, you're spending $10.50 on a $6 smoothie, losing even more. The only instance where you're not losing money would be at Seasons/UDCC/Conversations where a meal cost $11 but if you buy enough Dining Dollars, you get a discount though, so even that evens out for the same cost.



So overall, you're going to save money on pretty much any meal bundle you use, have more freedom for your meals (Don't have to get 2 sides or can get whatever you want from the C-Store for a ""side"" instead for pretty much same price), and have the ability to use those extra dining dollars on whatever the hell you want.




In this post I use estimates, but I actually spent some time going through the actual numbers comparing a 50 meal block to equivalent dining dollars and the math checks out. This might not be true for the 25 meal blocks, but it should be even if anything. Also, the prices for blocks/DD can change so this might not be true for future years. Double check the math if you're hesitant and you should come to the same conclusion, just trying to help people out with this advice.",7,39,0.94,5797mz,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/5797mz/for_those_of_you_buying_meal_blocks_dont_buy/

[The original conversation](https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/lxqeld/iowa_state_university_official_iceberg_any/gpqnfai/) was buried pretty deep in the iceberg thread and OP and I thought it was worth opening a separate discussion.  As always, I can't guarantee any action on the part of ISU as a whole, but I have pretty good channels to Health Services and they are always receptive to constructive feedback on how they can improve their services.  

For context - student mental health has been a constant topic among ISU's public health and incident command teams since the pandemic started.  We are acutely aware that our community, like those on every other campus, was facing huge mental health challenges even before 2020 added the stressors of social isolation, national political upheaval, disrupted education, job loss, vicarious trauma, and existential dread.  Everyone's been marinating in stress hormones for a year and it can feel like the community, social, and psychological aspects of recovery are being ignored amid ongoing COVID politics and the rush to mass vaccination.  My comment on more than one occasion has been, ""we're about to exit the COVID pandemic only to find ourselves still in a mental health pandemic.""

So figuring out ways to make the most of our limited resources and connect the people in need with them is definitely part of the conversation.",0,9,,lyl62m,t3_lyl62m,/r/iastate/comments/lyl62m/how_can_we_make_students_more_aware_of_mental/gpu8z07/

5227,Comment,"This may be silly, but are you male or female? 

I ask because in my experience (myself and many friends of both sexes coming to ISU), men eat MUCH more. I started with 10 meals a week plan (not sure what plan that is now) and ended up knocking back to 7 a week (I'm female). My little sister did the same thing. As you go down in meals, your dining dollars go up, which is really nice for snacks around meal times, especially if you live close to a c-store. Also, you will be going out with friends, or to the grocery store, which will supplement a lot of meals. You also may go home for a weekend here and there, so you won't be eating at the dining centers! In contrast, my boyfriend and his best (male) friend started with the 10 meal a week plan, and ended up bumping up to 14 a week. They are up all their meals, and still had room in their bellies to go out for pizza later. 

I think they do plans in large blocks instead of per-week now, but I would recommend starting at the one that averages 10/week, and they allow you to change or adjust the first week as needed. 

Knowing what I know now, my advice is to get the lowest plan possible, invest in a microwave/toaster oven, and take a weekly trip to the grocery store. On campus meals are convenient, but if you go around usual meal times, GOOD LUCK trying to find a place to sit. That's the first thing that I noticed and really didn't like. Also, it's very easy to overeat when your options/servings are literally endless. You think you'll get a salad going in, and then 30 minutes later you've devoured a fried buffalo chicken sandwich and a bowl of lucky charms. When you're studying, too, a quick sandwich is going to be much easier and more appealing than bundling up to head to the dining center. I lived in Martin, and there were plenty of days where walking the 200 yards to the UDCC was too much of a commitment, and I ended up eating toast and apples in my dorm.

Welcome to ISU! Any questions you have, feel free to PM me. I've got family and friends in/graduated from almost every major field here. It's a great place!",2,3,,3cjwio,t3_3cjwio,/r/iastate/comments/3cjwio/meal_plans/cswanq8/

5231,Comment,"You‚Äôre correct in that it‚Äôs hard to predict exactly, there are several indicators out there on why it‚Äôs problematic. One indicator is governmental programs that require a working force to pay into, such as social security and Medicare/Medicaid, which is already a disaster at the moment. Decreasing the amount paid into said programs can‚Äôt really be spun into a positive. 

Secondly, there‚Äôs countries out there experiencing worse levels of the problem. Japan often gets touted as an example, but the recent introduction of China‚Äôs two-child policy indicates they reduced their birth rate to a dangerous level. 

Immigrants fit very well into US culture due to the US being an immigrant country, but there is always backlash when large groups are first assimilated. Examples of this in history can be seen from the Italians, Irish, and Chinese. From an economic standpoint, major reform needs to be made to the immigration system before this becomes a viable solution. As it stands currently, the cost to bring in an immigrant costs more than the taxes they would pay into the systems in their first couple years. This could be seen as an investment, but historically the investment doesn‚Äôt pay off unless the first generation of immigrants leads to a second generation ([WP (Opinion)](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/can-immigration-save-the-us-from-its-birthrate-crisis/2019/01/15/2c546262-1907-11e9-8813-cb9dec761e73_story.html) .

5236,Post,"Im going to be a junior coming to Iowa State for Electrical Engineering next fall. I know that the coursework for engineering is time-consuming and that getting used to failure is a part of the major. So far, I have done well in my calculus and Physics courses. However, Im interested in studying Chinese, more particularly mandarin, and wanted to know if anyone has done this or if it is double. 

My reason for studying Chinese is that my girlfriend is an international student from china, and I would like to speak to her parents when they come over for our graduation within the next two years. I have tried Duolingo in the past and have been able to do very basic conversational skills. Still, when exams start, I end up dropping my streak and feel I need to find another alternative to the app to be more accountable for studying the language.

I would love to travel abroad to china during a summer semester next year, get immersed in the culture, and spend the summer in china with my girlfriend.

Is it better to learn Chinese on my own and not risk my GPA or stress by taking a language course in a University setting?",4,4,0.83,115muc3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/115muc3/engineering_and_language/

**Vaccination**

Pop-up clinics will continue on campus through September.  [See here for dates, times, and locations](https://web.iastate.edu/safety/updates/covid19/vaccinations).  Anecdotally, my Thielen colleagues are seeing significant demand.  Thank you to everyone who has come out to get vaccinated.

HyVee will offer vaccinations at a pop-up clinic at the UNI game this Saturday.  They'll be operating 10:00-1:30 on the stadium side of Stephens Auditorium.  [Full press release here](https://hy-vee.com/corporate/news-events/news-press-releases/hyvee-to-host-vaccination-clinic-before-cyclones-football-season-opener-against-uni-on-saturday/).

At this time, I have no updates on third doses of Pfizer and Moderna, nor on boosters for J&J.  ACIP is still deliberating whether or not to recommend this for the general population.  See previous updates for discussion of this item.

*****

**Testing**

We're seeing reports that over-the-counter home test kits are getting scarce.

No other updates on testing - see previous updates for discussion of your testing options.

*****

**Academics**

Yesterday, Provost Wickert announced new guidance for instructors who test positive for COVID-19 this semester.  If they are able and willing to work remotely, they may shift their classes to all-online for the duration of their isolation periods (and not expend sick leave).  Those who are seriously ill, or who are not willing and able to work during isolation, will follow the standard practice of taking sick leave while the department arranges coverage.  [Full message on the Provost's page, here](https://www.provost.iastate.edu/policies/provost-s-office-communications/temporary-course-modality-changes-for-instructors-who-test-positive-for-covid-19).

(/u/organman91, please add that link to the megathread?  Thanks!)

*****

**Data**

IDPH announced today that they will update the state dashboard (https://coronavirus.iowa.gov/) again for a different data display.  The dashboard is supposed to start receiving updates on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays (previously only once a week on Wednesdays).

ISU will report weekly COVID numbers on the Moving Forward web site.  This data page will be located at https://web.iastate.edu/safety/updates/covid19/numbers.

Statewide, pediatric cases are 22% of new cases right now.  Returning to full-capacity, unmasked classrooms is yielding predictable results for an age group that can't be vaccinated.

Stay tuned.  If we're going to see a big local case spike from 801 Day, this is the week it should show up in county data.",12,30,0.92,pglivt,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/pglivt/periodic_unofficial_covid_update_september_2_2021/

5305,Comment,"I'm sure people will think I'm dumb, but I personally did a meal plan the one year I lived in an apartment off campus (I did 3 years in dorms, and 1 year off campus) and it was great for me. I got the meal plan with the least amount of meals on it. Somedays I would make lunch and bring it on campus, but I spent so much time on campus in research labs or the library, I liked being able to just walk to the MU for a meal.

Another thing to think about, are you a person normally on campus pretty late? My junior and senior year I basically lived at the lib because my ADHD made it nearly impossible for me to get any work done at home. It was a very regular thing for me to be at the lib until 10pm (but normally later like midnight) at least 4-5 nights a week. The last thing I wanted to worry about when I got home late was packing a lunch for the next day. So, the meal plan made sense for me. However, I know most people aren't like this so it may not be worth it.",0,6,,1evrx9r,t3_1evrx9r,/r/iastate/comments/1evrx9r/are_dining_dollars_worth_it_if_living_off_campus/liwv1z8/

I guess that the campus empties out and it is pretty lonely and bleak during the winter break. For folks who do stay back, how do you get to dining halls in the snow, if at all they stay open. If not, do we just have to grab a bite at Convos? where else can we get a bite on campus? Do we just use our dining dollars?

Also, what do you do to stay sane when the campus empties out? Not that the campus is hopping currently.

5330,Comment,"I am kind and compassionate, up until the moment you take an exam from me. After one of my exams, people often change their point of view.

(The following are my own opinions)

As to why instructors make tests so hard, let me give a few thoughts:

* Tests are often hard in the moment, but when we remove the tests from a high pressure situation they suddenly become reasonable. You often hear people making comments that this test was much harder than tests from previous semester, or from the practice tests; but then looking at the solutions you start to see that it wasn't so different. There is something about being put into a high pressure situation that makes your brain look at everything as though you had not seen it before and challenges amplify.
* When developing test problems we (instructors) have this innate belief that you have studied every problem that has ever been written and memorized every solution. Of course this is not a reasonable belief, though it is not far off for some people. So this belief then motivates the test writers to think about giving a problem unlike ones that had ever been seen before. There are two ways to go with this, one way is to keep adding layers of complexity; the other way is to break a problem down and then find a way to turn it around (making the problem not difficult, but rather different). I prefer the breaking the problem down and finding a new way to present, but in all honesty it is so much easier just to add on another layer of complexity. And of course after several years of adding on complexity, problems become ridiculously complicated.

I think that preparation for exams helps tremendously to develop confidence. Also relaxing and calming yourself for a few seconds, breathe in, breathe out, relax.

Ultimately the purpose of an exam is not to fail students, but to give students a sense of their knowledge. If everyone fails an exam or aces an exam, this is a bad exam. When there is a broad distribution of scores, this is a better exam.

(On a side note; I once wrote an exam that pretty much everyone in the class aced. *Worst feeling in the world*. I cried out ""As Newton as my witness, I will never write such an easy exam again."" And so far, I haven't.)",0,3,,i6qqq0,t1_g0ztqro,/r/iastate/comments/i6qqq0/ama_with_the_calculus_coordinator_steve_butler/g103k6x/

* [Iowa Department of Public Health Immunization Requirements](https://idph.iowa.gov/immtb/immunization/laws) (clearly states it's scope as a ""requirement for students attending licensed child care centers and elementary or secondary schools."")
* [Iowa Immunization Requirements](https://idph.iowa.gov/immtb/immunization/laws) \- Dept. of Public Health, which lead to...
* ""[Iowa Immunization Administrative Code - Chapter 7](https://idph.iowa.gov/immtb/immunization/laws)"" - ok now we're getting somewhere.
   * Provides a list of required vaccinations to attend school in Iowa, including post-secondary schools (i.e. college/university). I do not see anything about how additional vaccines can't be required here but I am 100% not a lawyer.
* [Iowa Legal Code for ""COMMUNICABLE AND INFECTIOUS DISEASES AND POISONINGS""](https://www.legis.iowa.gov/law/iowaCode/sections?codeChapter=139A&year=2021)
   * section 139A.8 is for ""Immunization of children"" and there is no corresponding ""Immunization of adults"" section and this is where ¬ß139A.26 lives (referenced in the document above)

5. Learn to drink. Studying is not a good substitute for drinking. You should definitely study but you should definitely learn to drink too. For first-time drinkers, I recommend refilling your can or bottle with water after emptying it, then drinking that. It will not only help you maintain a more sober state, but also make you look more hardcore and wash out the containers for recycling.

5381,Comment,"I lived in Helser. Welcome to ISU!

Meal Plans - you have to have one. Get the smallest available, trust me you will probably have plenty and if not can buy more. There is a certain time frame to switch meal plans so keep an eye on that but start with the smallest. iirc meals expire at the semester and dining dollars expire at the year. Dining dollars buy you stuff in the convenience store and other places around campus so if you still have some left at the end of the semester you can buy non perishable foods or the non food items (staples and ibuprofen and stuff like that.)

The 2 main dining centers are in the UDCC (big building right there, can't miss it. you will also get mail and packages here). First is the one upstairs (Union Drive Marketplace) I was never much of an early riser so I didn't have breakfast often but a selection of donuts, eggs, pancakes, waffles (make your own any time of day), and other breakfasty stuff was all okay. They have different stations with different foods. you can check out the website to see whats one the menu for each of the different places. http://www.dining.iastate.edu/menus
In general I thought their food was run through a ""de-flavorizer"". The pizza can often be undercooked and they managed to ruin pancakes for me once. PANCAKES. thats some skill right there (or severe lack of) but for the most part it was a solid OK to MEH. They do have a soft serve ice cream/fro yo thing so beware the Freshman 15. 

Second up is Clyde's. I prefered to eat there. You can order online (idr the website, look for it when you walk in or ask) to avoid the line. Godfather's pizza and overall food quality is slightly better, if not the choice of a buffet. You get entree, drink, and 2? sides. Often I saved a side or two in my mini fridge for the days you don't want to leave the building for food and was still satisfied. 

When it comes down to it dorms and meal bundles are way expensive. I paid something like $7,000 or so my freshman year on just housing and food. Break down your meal bundle to the price per meal, its probably upwards of $6-7 a meal. That's almost restaurant prices. How many of those meals are spent on a single bowl of cereal? Right now I live in UV, and pay $2700 a year for apt with all utilities paid (dated and has its problems but by fair best price you can get in ames) except gas. I'm not great about marking exactly what I spend on what but I guarantee I haven't spent even close to $4300 on food. Hell I'd be surprised if it was greater than $1500. That's almost three grand in savings right there. I don't have to get dressed and leave my space if I want to go get food. I can eat on my hours, not only when dining center is open, and have what I want made how I like it. I have my own bedroom and we have a full kitchen and living room. We have a fenced in patio (abiet not huge). Dorms are great for your first year, but sophomore year you should definitely look into UV or other options. 

Sorry for the long post. I'l be happy to answer any questions

**TL:DR** MEH, go to clyde's, expensive go UV instead sophomore year.",2,5,,4csd5v,t3_4csd5v,/r/iastate/comments/4csd5v/how_are_foods_from_isu_dining_hall/d1lcywn/

5406,Post,"*This is strictly an unofficial conversation between me and whoever comments, not any kind of official ISU survey or poll.*

Over the past couple of weeks, I've seen a lot of threads on the academic and mental health challenges that many of you are facing.  I haven't commented much because ~~I am completely bereft of empathy~~ ~~I am too old to understand~~ I haven't had much to add to the discussions and, TBH, we're at a point in the semester where I feel kind of powerless to affect a lot of the situations you are describing.

However, I am about to be on the periphery of some discussions around spring semester.  With [the recent announcement of the spring academic calendar and course modalities](https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/ist36c/spring_semester_jan_25may_6th_with_no_spring/) and the uncertainty around a vaccine timeline, I think we all understand that spring 2021 is unlikely to be the semester in which we ""go back to normal.""

With that in mind, I am listening.  What are your suggestions for measures that could make the spring semester suck less - academically, in residence life, in general student life?  I don't have a VP or a Ph.D after my name, so my capacity to effect policy change is usually measurable in numbers that round to zero, but I would like to start collecting reasonable and plausible ideas in case I have the opportunity to bring them forward.",87,84,0.98,j2py5k,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/j2py5k/how_could_we_make_spring_semester_less_awful/

My assumption is that the final exams will be seriously overhauled. Currently, ISU policy is to require that exam period meet no matter what; I'm betting a lot of them will be moved online. I can't imagine that English, for example, will do anything to but discourage instructors from meeting the final week. The finals for 250, 302, 309, etc. have historically been to appease the university requirement. Instructors would **love** to move them online--myself very much included.

5412,Post,"I am a freshman from out of state. When I was first accepted into Iowa State, I thought this would be a wonderful place to branch out and and grow socially. After seeing all it had to offer, I thought it would be the obvious choice. But then covid hit and changed everything.

Me being a clueless dumbass, I still thought this was the place to go and that somehow I would still get to have a great experience. But I was wrong.

On a warm summer day in August, I move into my tiny little single suite room. I went out to go exploring after my parents have left and I have organized my room. After checking out the dining center I was overwhelmed. So many strangers. I wanted to go up and introduce myself to anyone, but my anxiety and introversion took over. I get my plate and drink and find a place to sit by myself in the corner. 

I thought, maybe I should give it a few more days. But no luck. I thought maybe join some clubs. I go to a couple and introduce myself, yet I felt like I don't belong. An outsider. 

I then tried to be friendly and leave my dorm room open so people could say hi. But once again, people just walk by like my room doesn't even exist.

I have no friends, no one to connect to. I go days without talking to a single soul. The only time I ever talk is when I call my parents. Whenever I have free time or have no school work to do I sit and stare at the wall, wondering where I went wrong in life.

5441,Post,"After many years of delays and setbacks, CySat-1, developed primarily through Make To Innovate, will launch into space tomorrow morning!

CySat-1 is a 3U CubeSat about the size of a loaf of bread designed to measure Earth's soil moisture using a software defined radiometer. It will launch to the International Space Station on a Cygnus spacecraft launched on board a Falcon 9 rocket. This is a typical cargo resupply to the space station, carrying food, water, scientific equipment, and a lot more, including our satellite and another CubeSat from Arizona.

The CubeSats will be deployed from the ISS a few months after launch.

I spent four semesters and a summer working on the software and some of the hardware, it is going to be such a win to see it finally fly!

It will launch at 10:29 AM Iowa time from a launch pad in Florida if all goes well. You can watch at either of these 2 links, starting 15-30 minutes before liftoff:

...Man, I look so different with a beard.

This isn't everyone though, as there have been many teams throughout the years. There's a lot of people who have worked on this. I hope it works!

Note that while we are launching tomorrow, there's some stuff that still needs to be done on the ground side of things, most notably, setting up and configuring the ground antenna on the roof of Howe Hall and the antenna pointing system! This must be done between now and when the satellite is deployed from the ISS. I don't know if Matt is thinking this is going to be a small select team or dealt with by a new Make to Innovate team, but either way, consider joining Make to Innovate! The two people most involved with CySat have graduated, and we are going to need a lot of help!

Make to Innovate (AerE 294/494) is a project based learning course which I believe is open to all majors and all years. CySat is one of several really cool project teams within Make to Innovate.

It is also hoped that the new team will resume planning for CySat-2 soon. I'm currently compiling a massive list of everything we wish we had done differently so if you join you hopefully won't be as in the dark as we were!",15,183,0.99,1eiko0w,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/1eiko0w/cysat1_iowa_state_universitys_first_satellite/

I‚Äôve been thinking about the idea of starting a Blockchain Club here at ISU, and I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on it.

What do you all think? Do you feel there‚Äôs a need for something like this on campus? If you‚Äôre into blockchain or just curious about it, what would you want to get out of a club like this?

5467,Post,"###Congratulations graduates!

Hello all, and congratulations to those that are graduating from ISU! I hope everyone had a great Fall and Spring semester.

For those of you that don't know me, I'm Mike and I've been with CyRide for over 9 years now. I started as a driver back in 2015, became a Transit Dispatcher in 2016, became a Transit Trainer in 2022. I'm responsible for onboarding, the early stages of training, and getting trainees their commercial driver's license (CDL.)

I will generally post CyRide updates here each semester to let everyone know what's going on with CyRide and what you can expect for the year. I'll also post updates for any major detours, severe weather, or anything else that might impact service.


---


###Summer Schedule

Summer schedule starts on Saturday, May 11th, 2024. Please review the [printed schedules](https://www.cyride.com/schedules/summer-schedule) and keep in mind that this weekend's service will go to 40 minutes for all routes. 

Weekday service is also reduced, so please review that as well. Also note that #21 Cardinal and #12 Lilac do not run at all during the summer time, that #25 Gold is significantly reduced (and turns around at Lake Laverne during the summer; it does not go to the towers.) MyState/Ames Ride/Google Transit *should* update in theory, but I would not rely on them 100%.

---

###Route update for #23 Orange 


Starting on Monday, May 13th, #23 Orange Route will be on a tempermanent (I just made that word up) detour for the next two years due to the [LeBaron expansion project.](https://www.amestrib.com/story/news/local/2024/04/24/iowa-state-university-lebaron-hall-is-getting-a-51-5-million-makeover/73387779007/) Morrill Road between Osborne drive will be inaccessible to CyRide buses during the entire duration of this project, which means Orange will be on an entirely different route during this time.

You can see the new Orange route [here.](https://www.cyride.com/maps/summer-maps/individual-route-maps-summer/23-orange-route-map)

If you noticed, it's not really that much different than normal Orange - it just goes one block further over to Bissell. This route change will significantly impact the timing of the buses, which I'll address in the Fall update, but we did add more lines of Orange to accommodate for the time delay.

Once Morrill Road reopens in 2026, Orange route should in theory go back to it's normal route down Morrill. 

---

###Detours

There are two seasons for Ames: ISU class season (Fall and Spring,) and construction season (summer.) Both present equal challenges for CyRide.

With construction season starting, we're going to see quite a few detours popping up throughout the summer. If you're sticking around and planning to ride, make sure to keep an eye on the CyRide website for detour updates. 

If you want a sneak peak at how construction impacts service, just take a look at what's going on up at the mall currently:

https://www.cyride.com/Home/Components/News/News/4054/1342?backlist=%2fhome

Notable road projects that will impact CyRide service include:

* 6th street from Northwestern Ave. to Brookridge Ave. (impacts #2 Green route)
* Welch road between Chamberlain and Knapp (no impact during the summer, but if it extends into the Fall semester it will impact #25 Gold.)
* Bell Ave from Dayton to Lincoln Way (impacts EASE)
* 24th St. - Stange road to Hayes Ave (impacts #14 Peach route) - current
* Lincoln Way - Beedle Dr. to Franklin Ave (impacts #1 Red route) - current



---


###Electric bus update

We've now had the Electric buses in use for about a year, and I know some people were curious about them, so I figured I'd provide a quick update for those.

The electric buses performed very well during the winter months, which I know is what most people were curious about. There was no significant impact on performance or range to my knowledge. 

I don't really have much else to say about them - they operate just like a normal bus!

---


###Moonlight Express

As a reminder, Moonlight Express does not run during the summer, and will NOT run this Friday, 5/10 or Saturday, 5/11. I will post additional information about Moonlight Express for the Fall update.

---

###Staffing update

In the past two years, we've hired 113 drivers according to my count. While not every single one of those stuck around, I'm pleased to say that after this *insane* staffing push, the light at the tunnel is finally visible.

To put things in perspective with how bad things were, we run about 4000 hours of scheduled service per week at CyRide, and every one of those hours has to run. When I came into this position in 2022, we had only about 2800 of those scheduled hours filled, meaning we had to figure out a way to fill 1200 hours of service *per week.* In 2023, that number was 900 hours. Many of those hours were filled by drivers picking up additional shifts, dispatchers picking up additional shifts, and pretty much all operations/administrative staff driving shifts.

We are now over 90% staffed, which has been a long term goal, but I still need to hire 20 new drivers this summer to account for attrition. If you're interested in becoming a transit driver, please apply! If you have any questions about becoming a driver, either shoot me a message on here or call CyRide and ask to speak to Mike (keep in mind I'm usually out training, so feel free to leave a voicemail and I'll get back to you.) Right now we're really looking for candidates that have weekday availability either between 7:00am-11:00am(ish) or 2:00pm-7:00pm(ish,) and we really need Friday help. Our nights and weekends are essentially fully staffed at this time, but that fluctuates from year to year. Summer is an excellent time to train as we don't have to work around class schedules and typically get people through much quicker.

*(Ames Transit Agency D.B.A CyRide is an Equal Opportunity Employer. Position is subject to drug and alcohol testing.)*

###TL;DR and Thank you!

As always, thank you for riding, and hopefully this update is helpful for new and current ISU students.

**TL;DR:**

* Saturday schedule starts Saturday, 5/11/2024. Check printed timetable info
* #23 Orange modified starting 5/13 until 2026.
* Sporadic detours this summer
* Electric buses are fine
* No MLX Friday 5/10 or Saturday 5/11 and until Fall semester
* Still hiring, reach out to me or check the City of Ames employment opportunities for details",3,67,1.0,1cnekye,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/1cnekye/cyride_summer_update/

# COVID Guidance and Resources

Yes, COVID is still a thing.  ISU's public health team continues to monitor local and national trends and emerging strains.  The official landing page for ISU COVID information and resources is now at https://health.iastate.edu/public-health/ and will remain updated throughout the semester.

## I think I might have COVID.  How do I get tested?

[Thielen Student Health Center](https://health.iastate.edu/covid-19-testing/) offers testing appointments for symptomatic students.  Call (515) 294-5801 to schedule an appointment.  You also can pick up free rapid antigen test kits and Test Iowa at-home test kits at locations listed at the preceding link.

Not sure which testing option you should use?  [ISU's public health team has a comparison chart for you](https://web.iastate.edu/sites/default/files/safety/COVID-19/COVID19TestOptions.pdf).

## I tested positive for COVID.  What do?

- If you have severe symptoms, seek medical care.

- Stay home for 5 days, counting your first day of symptoms (or first positive test if you're asymptomatic) as Day 0.  [Consult the isolation/quarantine flowchart for more information](https://health.iastate.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Isolation-quarantine-Flow-chart-08.22-1.pdf).

- Notify your instructors.  [Provost Wickert's fall 2022 public health guidance to all faculty](https://www.provost.iastate.edu/policies/provost-s-office-communications/fall-2022-public-health-guidance-and-syllabus-statement) includes a mandatory syllabus statement and sets parameters for what instructors can and can't require.  *Note that instructors still have the latitude to set their own attendance policies and [Thielen Student Health Center does not provide class excuse notes](https://health.iastate.edu/forms-policies/class-excuse-policy/).*

## I'm ready to get vaccinated/boosted.

The CDC currently recommends that everyone should get 1 booster after completing their primary COVID-19 vaccine series.  A second booster is recommended for persons age 50 or older, and moderately- or severely-immunocompromised persons age 12 or older.  [Current CDC booster recommendations are posted here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/booster-shot.html).

Thielen Student Health Center offers free COVID vaccinations for students.  Call (515) 294-5801 to schedule an appointment.  [Other local options are linked here](https://health.iastate.edu/covid-19-vaccinations/).

## What about masks?

You are welcome to welcome to wear a mask if you choose to do so.  Masking not only mitigates the transmission of COVID-19 but also helps reduce the spread of cold, flu, and other respiratory infections.  Thielen Student Health Center will continue to offer free masks to the campus community.

In accordance with [the Iowa Boards of Regents guidance from May 20, 2021](https://www.iowaregents.edu/news/board-news/statement-from-president-mike-richards-lifting-regents-state-of-emergency), ISU does not require masks on campus.

As per [a federal court order from April 18, 2022](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/masks-public-transportation.html), masking is no longer required on CyRide buses or other public transportation.

# Mental Health Resources

The pandemic sucked.  It disrupted (and continues to disrupt) many of the normal networks upon which we rely for support.  Across the campus community, many of us are still rebuilding connections - or struggling to establish new ones.  Feelings of isolation, anxiety, and depression should not be ""normal,"" but they sure are common right now.

This is a large, complex problem with no single or easy solution.  What works for one person may be not be the best option for another, so it may take some time to find *your* best answer.  This sub tends to be fairly supportive of posters with mental health concerns.  Peer support is a thing and the redditors here can point you to a lot of things that may contribute to a solution, from student organizations to online services.

## Crisis Intervention

If you are in immediate crisis or know someone who is, the Student Counseling page contains a list of [crisis resources for immediate mental health interventions](https://www.counseling.iastate.edu/in-crisis/).  

The National Suicide Prevention Hotline recently launched **988** as its new call center contact number.

## ISU Student Counseling

For those who want professional care, [ISU Student Counseling Services](https://www.counseling.iastate.edu/) is available.  They offer [individual and group counseling](https://www.counseling.iastate.edu/services/counseling/).  See their main page for a full list of services and resources.  They also have [a broader compilation of mental health resources posted here](https://health.iastate.edu/services/mental-health/mental-health-resources/).

If you're not in the right place to seek face-to-face services, Student Counseling also offers [Therapy Assistance Online (TAO)](https://www.taoconnect.org/what_is_tao/us/), a self-directed self-care program.

# Monkeypox

So, yeah, this is a thing now, too.  Ugh.  

Monkeypox is caused by a virus in the same family as smallpox, and it has similar symptoms, albeit less severe (but still *very* unpleasant) and rarely fatal.  The ISU public health team is monitoring the global and national progress of the current outbreak.  *As of this post, we haven't seen any cases in the campus community.*

## Do not want!!11eleven!!

Monkeypox transmission relies on close or skin-to-skin contact with a symptomatic person, or contact with objects or surfaces used by someone with it.  Avoid close contact with anyone who has a rash that looks like monkeypox.

## More info?

Right now, ISU is pointing to CDC and WHO resources, including [this fact sheet for young adults](https://www.cdc.gov/poxvirus/monkeypox/pdf/MPOX-info-teens-young-adults.pdf).  If that changes, we'll push information to the campus community through official channels.

-----

# Not Public Health Stuff

Historically, COVID-19 and monkeypox (and communicable diseases in general) have not been top killers of American college students.  The things that tend to be most lethal to this subreddit's dominant demographic are accidental injuries and suicide.  Of those accidental injuries, traffic accidents accounted for about half of them, and two-thirds of those involved alcohol.

In other words, statistically speaking, the most dangerous thing you do all semester may be driving home from Iowa City after the Cy-Hawk game.

As for the suicide issue: please refer back to the mental health resources above.  Think now about how you'll get the appropriate support systems in motion if you encounter a friend in crisis.

## Never walk into a place you don't know how to walk out of.

The best way to deal with a dangerous situation is to be somewhere else.

Every classroom on this campus should have a copy of the [ISU Emergency Response Guide](https://www.ehs.iastate.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/publications/posters/EmergencyPoster.pdf) posted.  On the first day of each class, ask your instructor about evacuation routes, severe weather shelters, and how to respond to a violent incident if an emergency occurs during that class.  If they don't have that information, take a few minutes to explore the building on your own and figure out how you'll get out or get to shelter.

Do the same thing for your residence hall.  Know a secondary way out of the building if the primary escape route is blocked.  This will be useful when some drunken jackass pulls the fire alarm at 3am during midterms, then slips, falls, blacks out, and slimes the stairwell with his vomit.  \#oddlyspecificemergency

## CyRide is the apex predator of the unwary freshman.

Look both ways before crossing the street.  Yes, even if you're playing Pokemon Go.  In a tie between you and a bendy bus, the bus wins.

## OMG WTF 911

The way our society generally treats personal safety for young adults kinda sucks.  The script goes something like, ""congratulations, now that you're an adult and in college, you're on your own and your safety is your own responsibility, but we didn't actually teach you what that means.""  That's true insofar as you *are* the person responsible for your own safety, and you need to own that.  

However, a lot of people on this campus have job descriptions in that arena, too.  If you have questions or concerns, you can reach out to /u/Emergen_Cy (ISU's emergency manager, responsible for disaster preparedness and karma farming), /u/CycloneHealth (the unofficial account for Thielen Student Health Center), or /u/ISUPD (which may not be monitored since Detective Ferret Bueller ate the Post-It on which the password was written).  All of us are here to ensure that at the end of the semester, most of you go home to your families in more or less the same condition you were in at the beginning of the semester.",12,52,0.96,wrr4d3,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/wrr4d3/fall_2022_covid19_and_other_safety_and_public/

* So one big nudge in the right direction is to focus on getting the setup of problems correct.  Everything after that is usually not too bad.

5510,Post,"I'm by no means a legal expert, so if I'm wrong in any aspect of my list, please let me know. These are taken from the housing contract, which includes the policy handbook, both of which are legally binding to anyone housing with Iowa State.

1. DOR staff and/or ISU police MAY enter your dorm room/univ. apartment without a search warrant. Non-university employees may not (that would mostly pertain to Ames police). 

2. There are certain rules both of these entities must follow when entering your room. For starters, if it's not an emergency, they must give you 24 hours notice.

3. There are very specific reasons for which they can enter your dorm room/univ. apartment; NONE OF THESE INCLUDE SUSPECTING POSSESSION OF ALCOHOL OR OTHER ILLEGAL SUBSTANCES.

4. Once they do enter your residence, they cannot look in ""closed wardrobes, closets, desks or dresser drawers, trunks, luggage, etc."" In other words, if they can't see it without touching/moving/opening something, they won't find it.

5. If they DO see alcohol and/or illegal substances, they will take them and give you a written notice of what was taken. AS FAR AS I KNOW, they cannot charge you with anything they find. This rule is similar to the way police forces work - if someone crashes a car into your living room, the police will enter your home to make sure everyone is alright; if you have a bong on your coffee table, they'll take it with them and later dispose of it, but they cannot charge you with it since they did not have a search warrant (See [Mapp v. Ohio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mapp_v._Ohio)).

6. If they do have a legitimate search warrant, rule 1-5 are out the window.

The only other thing to note is that if it's ISU police, I wouldn't consent to a search as a precaution - it's not entirely clear if they act as police officers or DOR staff in this situation. If they 1) don't have a warrant, 2) aren't there due to an emergency, or 3) haven't given you 24 hours notice, you have no reason to let them in.",17,20,0.89,1q2ty2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/1q2ty2/another_friend_just_got_a_mip_charge_so_i_did_a/

5513,Comment,"Interesting question.  :)  The short answer is that you're not likely to see something exactly like that any time soon, barring a massive shift in federal, state, and Board of Regents priorities.  However, I do have some other projects on my desk that will address some parts of the issue.

The longer answer (if anyone cares) has a couple of aspects:

First, the old Nuclear War Survival Plan was a product of an era in which we as a country really only planned for nuclear war.  Every other disaster was handled on an ad hoc basis.  During the latter years of the Cold War, there was a realization that many of the preparedness programs intended for a nuclear exchange could also be used for other types of disasters.  

This yielded what we now call ""all-hazards preparedness,"" in which we plan and prepare in terms of effects (what are disasters going to do to us) and capabilities (what do we want to be able to do) rather than writing parallel plans for multiple hazards.  So rather than a modern nuclear war plan, you're more likely to see a state or city or university put out an emergency operations plan that has nuclear war as one of its identified hazards, along with other stuff like floods, tornadoes, hazmat releases, and terrorist geese.

The second part of the answer is that the old Nuclear War Survival Plan was a local element of nationwide civil defense efforts which had a lot of federal mandates (and federal funding) behind them.  Starting in the 1980s, and accelerating rapidly after 1991, the federal government lost interest in civil defense and stopped providing federal funding to local programs.  In the absence of that, ISU isn't likely to be able to find or allocate the funding to buy and rotate supplies or maintain dedicated fallout shelter spaces.",1,7,,wrr4d3,t1_ikyhl8h,/r/iastate/comments/wrr4d3/fall_2022_covid19_and_other_safety_and_public/ikyqiit/

5517,Post,"###Happy Spring Semester!

Welcome back from break everyone!

For those of you that don't know me, I'm Mike and I've been with CyRide for 10 years (on February 4th, 2025.) I started as a driver back in 2015, became a Transit Dispatcher in 2016, became a Transit Trainer in 2022, and am now the night operations manager at CyRide.

I will generally post CyRide updates here each semester to let everyone know what's going on with CyRide and what you can expect for the year. I'll also post periodic updates for any major detours, severe weather, or anything else that might impact service.

There's a few things that are we are implementing soon or have already implemented since the last update, so I'll make sure to cover all of those. If you have any questions, feel free to let me know! There's also a TL;DR at the bottom you'd just like the basics.

---


###Spring Schedule

~~[Full service*](https://www.cyride.com/schedules/school-year-schedule) starts Tuesday, January 21st.~~ (SEE BELOW)

For today Monday, January 20th we will still be running a [weekday break schedule](https://www.cyride.com/schedules/break-schedules) as there are no ISU classes for the MLK holiday.

Prediction services should be updated and accurate on all prediction apps.

##UPDATE: I just received notice that classes will be cancelled at Iowa State University on Tuesday, January 21st due to cold weather. We will still be running all routes, however, Orange route only will go down to a break schedule so it will not come every 4 minutes. So in short, all routes and lines are running, but orange has been reduced.

---

###Token Transit

CyRide has partnered with [Token Transit](https://tokentransit.com/riders/download) which will allow riders to purchase digital bus passes. This is meant to run in conjunction with our current bus pass services, so physical bus passes will still be available for purchase at locations like the CyRide office, City Hall, and HyVee.

Token Transit users may purchase a one ~~day~~ ride pass or a monthly pass through the app.

For those that are eligible for reduced-fare, you will need download the app and make an account, then call or email CyRide and we will put an authorization on your account to purchase reduced fare.

This information is likely not relevant for 99% of ISU students - for ISU students that pay the activity fee, there are no changes. 

Token Transit will go live on Tuesday, January 21st, 2025.

---

###Bus prediction applications (Transit App, MyState, AmesRide.)

As stated in the [Fall 2024 update post](https://old.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/1ew8owl/cyride_fall_2024_update_welcome_back_to_isu/), CyRide has partnered with [Transit App](https://transitapp.com/) and is providing the premium version of this, Transit App Royale, for FREE for all CyRide users. Download the CyRide version of the Transit App using the links below. 

MyState and Transit App are two CyRide supported applications. If these aren't your style, Ames Ride is also a great alternative that provides excellent predictions and was created by your own ISU Alumni, Patrick Demers.

You can download any of these on your app store:

* MyState ([Apple link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mystate/id548641772)) ---
 ([Google Play link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.iastate.MyState))
* Transit App ([Apple link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/transit-subway-bus-times/id498151501)) --- ([Google Play link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thetransitapp.droid))
* AmesRide ([Apple link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ames-ride/id1666007719)) --- ([Google Play link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.demerstech.amesride))

---

###Technology updates

* Pilot shelter displays - If you have been at Upper Friley or Student Services, you may have noticed the displays in the shelters that provide predictive information, and we plan to implement more of these at major bus stops in the future. Any feedback with these is welcome!

* Infotainment displays in buses - We have added infotainment screens in 11 more buses which provide predictive information, upcoming stops, and much more!

As CyRide continues to modernize our fleet, you can expect to see more ""21st century"" hardware to improve your experience.

---


###Fleet updates

CyRide has ordered five more battery electric buses, with federal grants covering the overwhelming majority of the expense per bus. As Nova (our current battery bus manufacturer) has ceased operation within the United States, we have procured these five from Gillig instead. These buses significantly reduce CyRide's carbon footprint, are cheaper to ""fuel"", and can go pretty much all day on a single charge. These buses are also charged overnight during non-peak hours, optimizing cost and efficiency.

We've also ordered two more 60' articulated buses from New Flyer and two more Gillig low floor buses as we continue to phase out our older fleet of Orion V's (sorry, those comfy red leather seats will be going away within the next 5-10 years!) These new buses are more fuel efficient and produce significantly lower emissions. 

All of the above buses should be on CyRide grounds within the next 12 months.

We've also completed our Biodiesel conversions on five of our Gillig low floor buses - these have two fuel tanks - one for regular diesel and one for biodiesel. When the engine gets warm enough these will automatically switch to biodiesel (essentially vegetable oil) for normal operation, and when they shut down they purge the biodiesel until regular diesel is in the lines to reduce gelling in the wintertime. It's a pretty neat conversion that's tried and true - the same conversion is utilized on many snow plows throughout Iowa.

--- 
###Fare Free on campus

Just a reminder, we are still fare-free at all stops on campus until 2026 (due to Morrill road closure.) If you're on the border of campus and not sure, just look for the ""fare free"" sticker on the bus stop signs. You do not have to show your ID, bus pass, or pay a fare if you board at any of these stops.

For bus stops outside of campus, you will still need to show your ID, pass, or pay fare (or use Token Transit!)

---


###Moonlight Express - reminder


[Moonlight Express](https://www.cyride.com/schedules/school-year-schedule/moonlight-express) is a free option for a safe ride home that operates on Friday and Saturday nights from 10:30pm-3:00am while classes are in session. You do not need to pay a fare or show your ISU card to use these services.

Moonlight Express is split into two sections - Fixed route and door to door.

The Moonlight Express ""A"" shuttle follows a fixed route and runs every 20 minutes between West Ames and Campus. See the A shuttle map [here](https://www.cyride.com/maps/school-year-maps/moonlight-express-service-maps/moonlight-a) and the timetables [here.](https://www.cyride.com/schedules/school-year-schedule/moonlight-express/a-shuttle-timetable)

The Moonlight Express ""B"" shuttle also follows a fixed route and runs every 20 minutes between Freddy Court and Campus. See the B shuttle map [here](https://www.cyride.com/maps/school-year-maps/moonlight-express-service-maps/moonlight-b) and the timetables [here.](https://www.cyride.com/schedules/school-year-schedule/moonlight-express/b-shuttle-timetable)

If you need a ride outside of the service zones of the above A & B shuttles, we offer an On-Demand service and can generally get a minibus to you within 10-15 minutes, depending on demand for the night. Call the CyRide office OR download the free [Ride Pingo app](https://ridepingo.com/) through iOS or Android and schedule through that. You can also call CyRide to schedule a ride.

Moonlight Express will be operating starting on Fridays and Saturdays starting 1/25/2025 until Spring break.

### TL;DR and Thank You!


As always, thank you for riding, and hopefully this update is helpful for new and current ISU students. If you have any comments, questions, or concerns, feel free to drop a comment on this post and I'll try to get back to you as soon as possible.


#TL;DR:
* Monday, 1/20/2025 is a weekday break schedule
* Full service starts Tuesday, 1/21/2025 at the start of service until Spring Break - due to ISU being closed, orange will be the only thing affected for Tuesday and will just be reduced trips.
* For non-ISU students, you can download the Token Transit app to purchase digital daily or monthly bus passes, if in need of reduced fare call or email CyRide
* Download MyState, Transit App, or Ames Ride for real time prediction information
* New fancy displays with prediction information in shelters and buses with more to come
* 5 more battery electric buses, 2 more articulated buses, and 2 new Gillig low floors coming in the next 12 months or so, also some buses have a biodiesel conversion
* Orange is still on detour until 2026, fare free on campus until then - look for ""fare free"" signs on bus stops
* Moonlight Express starts this weekend until Spring Break

5536,Comment,"I don't know if I will be much of a good conversationalist in this area. I have personal bias in that I don't believe that the calculus program is a disservice nor a waste of money. This is in large part because of my connections to the calculus program; in particular I was the one who set up the current model of coordinated calculus six years ago. But I do have a few thoughts.

Math in general is an important class as mathematical tools show up frequently in STEM disciplines (and as a reminder the full name of this school is ""Iowa State University of Science and Technology""). So students need to develop mathematical tools and the best way to do that is through courses in mathematics. You might argue that mathematic courses are now dated because ""we have technology and AI will do it all for us"". They could have made similar arguments 40 years ago with the introduction of personal calculators, 150 years ago with the widespread adoption of the slide rulers, or even 2500 years ago with the abacus. But we still value math courses because tools are only useful if we can understand them and know how to use them. And mathematics is a great way for us to be able to understand what is happening and figure out how to effectively use tools. At its core math wants people to understand the world.

As to the specifics you raise, when we ""pass students with 50 is \[SIC\] percent"" it should be noted that the initial cutoff for passing starts at 60 percent and there is some adjustment down to account for difficulty or unexpected outcomes (e.g. this semester we are introducing multiple choice problems on exams and will need some time to fine tune it, so we want the ability to adjust the cutoffs if needed). That said the cutoffs for A's and B's tend not to move much. So a student who passes at 50 percent is likely a student who passed with a ""D"" grade, which indicates that the student is mediocre in that material. It is therefore not surprising that someone who has mediocre knowledge in the subject at one level would struggle in the next level.

As to why students struggle in classes, it is a combination of many things. There are students who start out in the wrong course in that their prerequisite knowledge is not strong enough (e.g. mediocre); there are students who do not have the study skills to succeed in demanding courses (coming out of the pandemic this seems to have gotten worse); there are students who have challenging situations which distract them from succeeding (e.g. food insecurity); and many more.

One of the good things about how calculus is set up at Iowa State is that it is not a matter of struggling because of a lack of resources. The calculus program has copious resources available for students in the form of help hours, recordings, posted old exams, SI, ability to study in groups, etc. This is more so than any other major course on campus, and also more so than any other major calculus program at other institutions. Ironically we might have the opposite problem that many students usually experience, namely having far too many resources and not knowing which ones to most effectively use.

I suppose all of this is to say that I think the calculus program has some positives going for it. Do I think there could be improvements? Absolutely! As one fellow faculty member a few doors down put it (here paraphrased) ""We teach calculus the wrong way, everything that teaching theory says we should do, we do the opposite."" To which I replied, ""Yes, but given the resources."" To which they chimed in, ""Yes, given the resources we are amazing.""

It is my opinion that the calculus program is in a good place. I would want to see it get better, and I do believe we can be much more effective. However, that will not happen with the current resources that we have.

Directing anger at the faculty who work hard and long hours into the night (essentially much of it unpaid overtime) will not help improve your classes. If anything it causes those faculty who are doing the most to help the students want to stop. Start telling administration that you want a better learning experience and demand that they start putting more resources into the classroom to get the learning experience that you want, the learning experience that you deserve.",2,28,,1flv0az,t3_1flv0az,/r/iastate/comments/1flv0az/calc_classes/lo9519e/

1. Nowadays I don't have a lot of free time; I spend way too much of it thinking about calculus. Yesterday I went out to buy an egg slice and strawberries to get ready for making my next recorded lecture, and today I will probably spend a lot of time recording calc 2 lectures; tomorrow will be calc 3 lectures and so on.

Even those of us with ""normal"" face perception will observe that although we may be able to form an image in our minds of what somebody's face looks like, and we certainly couldn't begin to describe it in words.

5608,Post,"It's beginning to warm up, which means that it's construction season. Currently, Bissell is closed, which means buses will be utilizing Hyland/Pammel (cemetery hill) and not servicing Howe or Sweeney Hall. (We were going behind design and through the design parking lot, but effective 3/25 we have received requests from ISU to utilize Hyland instead.) A comprehensive detour map [can be seen here](https://www.cyride.com/home/showdocument?id=9648) and detour information [can be seen here.](https://www.cyride.com/Home/Components/News/News/3186/1342?backlist=%2f)

**IF YOU RIDE BLUE ROUTE**, please pay attention to the detour. For time's sake along with the fact that Wallace will be closed relatively soon, Blue will not be doing the southern loop through campus, so all stops on Wallace, MU, Lower Friley, CVS, Lway & Lynn, and Buchanan will all **not be serviced by Blue** as noted on the detour map. Note that it will detour down beach and go straight down Beach, so if you're trying to get to Stadiumview, South 3rd, 4th, & 5th, and Walmart/Target, you will need to catch it *inbound* on campus only. 

**Additionally**, ~~Kildee/Bessey are closed until construction with Bessey is completed. This may be confusing because construction equipment may not be there in the early morning or at night time, but for consistency's sake we will be bypassing Kildee/Bessey and servicing MacKay/Physics instead. We have also opened temporary bus stops outside of the East gates on Osborne, so you can catch it there as well. A detour map (where to catch the bus) for Kildee/Bessey [can be seen here](https://www.cyride.com/home/showdocument?id=9654) and information [can be seen here](https://www.cyride.com/Home/Components/News/News/3188/1342?backlist=%2f)~~

Wallace will also be closing here in the near future due to the [Gerdin Business Building expansion](http://www.iowastatedaily.com/news/academics/gerdin-business-building-expansion/article_2066717e-e145-11e8-8244-8367281eadc3.html) which means that 23 Orange and 21 Cardinal will also be affected. We have no plan for detours yet, but keep an eye on Cyride's website along with Facebook/Twitter updates for detour information when it is posted. From what I've heard, Wallace will be closed for the better part of a year, so it will definitely go into the Fall of 2019.

If anyone has any questions, feel free to respond to this post, PM me, or call Cyride directly. 

Hope you all had a good spring break!",11,129,1.0,b5g2t2,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/b5g2t2/cyride_psa_massive_detours_going_on_right_now/

Join the Honors Student Board and ISU Emergency Management for a tabletop disaster simulation.  You'll play the roles of ISU and Ames leaders in this discussion-based event, facing a scenario of a natural gas explosion in Friley Windows.  Based on an actual incident that occurred at the University of Nevada in Reno, this exercise will put you in charge of the immediate emergency response and the strategic planning for long-term disaster recovery.

**Who:** This is an HSB event but all ISU students* are welcome.  No prior knowledge of emergency management is required.

**When:** Monday, March 29, 4pm-6pm.

**Where:** 1151/1155 Jischke.  *This is an in-person event*.  Due to the format, there is not an online component.  

**COVID Precautions:** Standard classroom protocols apply: face coverings required, 50% capacity, don't lick other people's stuff.

**How:** Space is limited, so please RSVP at https://forms.gle/5afwkW7yLf2E2fFE7 to ensure you have a seat.

Seasons is the other dining center in the Richardson Court Neighborhood and it is an easy walk (less than five minutes) from all of those dorms. Your classes will probably be all over campus for your first year. Campus is very walkable and you'll figure out the CyRide schedule pretty fast.

FWIW, I really enjoyed living in Wilson and made a lot of friends there. There's two buses that go from Towers to campus so it's easy to get wherever you need to go. The meal plan also isn't required in Wilson (or Linden) so you can get a smaller one and save some money, if that matters to you. There's a few hundred other students living in Wilson who are also going to be learning bus schedules, where to eat, etc., so you won't be alone if you do choose to live there.

5665,Comment,"As I current CA I have a few things to say. 

* As far as I have been told, we can not enter a room without permission from the people that say in that room. A friends permission doesn't count. Anytime I have, or the the police have entered a room, I have always asked permission first. If you don't give a CA permission to enter there is nothing that we can do. We can only call the police if we think someone in the room may need medical attention or we smell marijuana. If you don't give the police permission they may get a search warrant, I have seen this happen before.

* I have never been told, let alone heard, about the 24 hour thing. I have seen the police get go to a room, get denied access, leave and return with a search warrant. The only time I have seen the police get a search warrant was for marijuana and other drugs. I have never heard the police say we will be back in 24 hours. Usually one officer says by the room while the other goes to get eh warrant. As I have said before if a resident gives permission I, or the police, can enter a room. 

* CAs are told that if we smell marijuana that we are supposed to call the police immediately and let them handle the ordeal. We just stand there and take notes. The police can enter the room if given permission or with a warrant. As far as alcohol goes, if we see it we have to document it and have you pour it out. The only time I have ever entered a room during an alcohol case was to make sure that everyone in the room was coherent. I have never seen a CA pry through someones belongings without permission. I have actually never seen a CA go through someones stuff. Usually the CA will ask the person if there is any more alcohol in the room. If they say no we just take care of what is visible. 

* I have seee people charged for things without a search warrant numerous times, whether it be marijuana, alcohol, or other drugs. Once you give permission to enter your room you can be charged for anything that is found. 

If you all really don't want to get in trouble do the following:

* drink off campus

* don't keep illegal things in your room

* don't smoke anywhere near campus and change your clothes before you get back to your room

* if you are drinking in your room don't blast your music before or after quiet hours, don't have your room jammed full of people, and don't be loud

* don't let people who reek of marijuana in to your room

5674,Comment,"This year feels like the biggest opportunity to win the Big12 in a long time. Theres so much coaching turnover that WVU, Texas Tech, and the Kansas teams dont really feel like an immediate threat for upsets. Baylor and OSU are gonna be competitive, but in confident that the boys can take them down without too much issue. 

Texas is a huge threat, but I agree that they are being overrated quite a bit, since they lost a lot of production in the offseason. Ehlinger is no joke, but I dont think hes quite elite enough to carry the team on his own. Texas is the last team that Campbell needs to beat to say hes beat every Big12 team, so he should be gearing up for that game in the biggest way.

Obviously OU is the real deal: arguably the best offense in the NCAA last year, and they just replaced Murray with Jalen Hurts, not to mention they recruited a LOT of defence for this year. Their biggest weakness is that their entire O line either went pro or graduated, which means their line this year will be inexperienced and unfamiliar with each other and their QB, which can be a huge downfall for that position. Put that on top of their shitty defence (if they stick with last years players) or a very young defence (if they start their new recruits) and I think they're just vulnerable enough that we could pull of the upset.

A lot of people are sleeping on us for losing the big 2 names to the NFL, who accounted for a vast majority of our offensive production, and tbh I almost agree. At RB we have a ton of depth in Nuengu (probably spelled wrong) and the two big recruits that we got, and at WR we got some big transfers and recruits on top of Jones. If our starters at corner can perform as well as Peavey and co. then our defence should be dominant, and maybe the most hopeful position is our O line since all 5 are returning.

5687,Comment,"Hey! This is, like, my thing!

Here's some context.
Birds collide with windows for two reasons: Depending on the time of day, they either can't see the glass, or the glass reflects nearby habitat. Birds aren't dumb. They literally cannot see it.

When a bird hits glass, they may die on impact, get a concussion, or suffer from internal bleeding. If they are left on the ground long enough, a predator may pick them off. Sometimes, the bird may be on the ground for about 15 minutes, and fly off. However, we don't know what the death rate is for birds that suffered from window collision injuries.

In the U.S., MILLIONS of birds die every year at the hands of glass - anywhere between 300 and 980 million. With the exception of habitat loss, window collisions are the second largest anthropogenic-caused killer of birds (behind outdoor cats - PSA: keep your cats indoors).

What can we do about it?

Well, we can't just knock down buildings/replace all windows - that is expensive and unrealistic. At home, consider putting specially-designed applications on the EXTERIOR of your windows. [Here is a helpful section of the American Bird Conservancy on how to do this](https://abcbirds.org/program/glass-collisions/).

Businesses can follow suit, but there are other options available. Designers can avoid building corridors on the outside of their buildings - trapped birds are more likely to fly into the glass rather than over the building (because they may put themselves at risk to avian predators by flying over).

Architects may consider using etched glass - it's attractive to the eye, and as long as the patterning on the window meets the spacing requirement for bird-friendly applications (2 in by 2 in), it will also be effective.

UV-coated glass also exists, although it is less effective than other bird-friendly measures. Most birds can see in the UV spectrum, but humans can't, so the coating remains visible to them and not us. However, not all birds can see in this spectrum (aka Mourning Doves, who hit windows frequently). UV-coated glass is expensive as well.

To add to ALL OF THAT, there are also LEED certifications you can get for following bird-friendly measures!

So why don't they do it? It just isn't a well-known issue, and people don't know that solutions exist. (Note: not all people though, multiple cities throughout the country have adapted bird-friendly practices, such as Cleveland and New York City.)

What are people in Ames doing about it?
A couple things, actually! [Story County is working on being a bird-friendly county](https://www.amestrib.com/news/20191022/supervisors-approve-application-request-to-become-bird-friendly-county). That's a good step.

But let's not ignore that ISU makes up a big part of this town. Personally, I observed many dead birds on campus back in 2018. I designed a building-monitoring project alongside a biology professor, and got funding from the Iowa Ornithological Union to do it. This past fall, myself and other students monitored a handful of buildings, and donated specimens in good shape back to the university (they can be used for teaching students, or in future research that requires genetic material). Here are some of the birds we found (warning: dead birds): https://imgur.com/a/HPXd8qJ.

The professor and I brought in a window-collision expert and consultant, and she gave an EEOB lecture back in November. She also spoke with members of Facilities and Planning about the issue of birds hitting windows. I showed her around campus, and she was appalled at the Student Innovation Center.

It was my plan to monitor the building as soon as it opened, but given the situation, I was unable to do that. However, I'll be going at it again this fall. The goal is to convince the university to adapt some protocol for future buildings, and maybe get custodians on-board with reporting collisions.

**TL;DR: bird-friendly design is available, but it's hard to adapt to existing structures. I collect dead birds on campus, and hope to raise awareness of this issue.**",2,102,,g78n5h,t3_g78n5h,/r/iastate/comments/g78n5h/student_innovation_center_vs_birds/fog3qnx/

5692,Comment,"Op thanks for posting this. It's very therapeutic to read all these posts and relate so much to everyone. Literally, everyone was going through it during COVID-19, and I truly wonder what will happen to society in the future because of social distancing. 

Here is my story. Preface I'm now one semester from being an Aerospace Engineer (2019-2024) and I was on a four year full ride scholarship. Covid-19 social distancing happened during my freshman year. First semester I was able to make friends, experience weed and alcohol for the first time a lot of the ‚Äúcollege experience‚Äù. I created a regiment for myself to stay on track went to the gym, went to class, and got on the dean's list freshman year. Spring I was on track to do the same. Then social distancing happened. My regiment went out the window.

I grew up being homeschooled but it was honestly very weird to go back home and do school. I was an adult now I didn't have a nagging parent so basically I ignored school, stopped doing homework, gamed all day, lost track of time, and passed my classes that semester either because I passed/failed them or there was a huge curve. I had signed a lease with my freshman roommate (also aerospace) in the Spring so the fall semester I was back in Ames. I also did the exact same thing I did the previous semester but applied myself somewhat or so I thought. I was placed on academic probation; my roommate though didn't apply himself and got on academic warning. This is kind of where all the mental illness shit started to happen. 

My roommate and I helped each other understand the classes we were taking we would discuss things and we would kind of help each other learn. Once he got an academic warning he stopped applying himself. He would only ever game and would never come out of his room. I felt I was taking the hardest engineering course by myself. I didn't know anyone else that was in aero besides my roommate. I also essentially lost my only friend at the time because he wouldn't socialize at all only game. I truly felt alone and sad and depressed. Even though I'm an engineer I love socializing and making friends.

I tried to hang out with my neighbors but I didn't feel invited or wanted. I felt out of place like I was forcing myself into companionship. I tried hanging with acquaintances but I soon learned why they were acquaintances. One day during winter break I went to their place and smoked- maybe too much, but I completely dissociated after from whatever was in the weed and never hung out with them again. Feeling off and in a dissociated state didn't help me in the social real. For the spring semester, I was in this dissociated state judging my actions out of my body. I know I was afraid I would lose my full-ride scholarship, but I seriously did not remember that spring semester or what I did. That spring semester I was placed on academic warning and my roommate got kicked out of ISU. I think that semester put me at a 2.66 GPA, before COVID I was at a 3.75. If I dropped below an overall 2.5 GPA I would lose my scholarship if my GPA the following semester was below 1.00 I would be kicked out of school. That semester I also got a new roommate which helped me socialize.

Coming back to ISU in person in 2021 I was in full fight-or-flight mode and I came to fight. I sought therapy and that helped me a lot lot, but I still went full feral mode to not lose my scholarship. I don't really remember that fall or spring semester. 

Coming back fall of 2022 was honestly when things got back to normal for me. I joined clubs, became president of a club and helped it regrow, went to bars, made deep connections, and lost some deep connections, but from what I've done I feel like I'm ready to graduate. I think graduating in five years over four has definitely helped me regain that sense of ownership of my college experience, but it has definitely come at the cost of my bank account‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve definitely learned a lot of valuable lessons about myself because of Covid. Lesson that I don't think I would have learned otherwise, but lessons I have only learned because I had to look deep into my soul. Lessons like that are scary. Loking back I should have dropped out of college for the sake of my mental health, but who knows if I'd be a semester away from being an Aero Engineer if I had.",0,6,,18vnz68,t3_18vnz68,/r/iastate/comments/18vnz68/covid_memories/kft8wdz/

Meal Plans - you have to have one. Get the smallest available, trust me you will probably have plenty and if not can buy more. There is a certain time frame to switch meal plans so keep an eye on that but start with the smallest. iirc meals expire at the semester and dining dollars expire at the year. Dining dollars buy you stuff in the convenience store and other places around campus so if you still have some left at the end of the semester you can buy non perishable foods or the non food items (staples and ibuprofen and stuff like that.)

The 2 main dining centers are in the UDCC (big building right there, can't miss it. you will also get mail and packages here). First is the one upstairs (Union Drive Marketplace) I was never much of an early riser so I didn't have breakfast often but a selection of donuts, eggs, pancakes, waffles (make your own any time of day), and other breakfasty stuff was all okay. They have different stations with different foods. you can check out the website to see whats one the menu for each of the different places. http://www.dining.iastate.edu/menus
In general I thought their food was run through a ""de-flavorizer"". The pizza can often be undercooked and they managed to ruin pancakes for me once. PANCAKES. thats some skill right there (or severe lack of) but for the most part it was a solid OK to MEH. They do have a soft serve ice cream/fro yo thing so beware the Freshman 15. 

Second up is Clyde's. I prefered to eat there. You can order online (idr the website, look for it when you walk in or ask) to avoid the line. Godfather's pizza and overall food quality is slightly better, if not the choice of a buffet. You get entree, drink, and 2? sides. Often I saved a side or two in my mini fridge for the days you don't want to leave the building for food and was still satisfied. 

When it comes down to it dorms and meal bundles are way expensive. I paid something like $7,000 or so my freshman year on just housing and food. Break down your meal bundle to the price per meal, its probably upwards of $6-7 a meal. That's almost restaurant prices. How many of those meals are spent on a single bowl of cereal? Right now I live in UV, and pay $2700 a year for apt with all utilities paid (dated and has its problems but by fair best price you can get in ames) except gas. I'm not great about marking exactly what I spend on what but I guarantee I haven't spent even close to $4300 on food. Hell I'd be surprised if it was greater than $1500. That's almost three grand in savings right there. I don't have to get dressed and leave my space if I want to go get food. I can eat on my hours, not only when dining center is open, and have what I want made how I like it. I have my own bedroom and we have a full kitchen and living room. We have a fenced in patio (abiet not huge). Dorms are great for your first year, but sophomore year you should definitely look into UV or other options. 

Sorry for the long post. I'l be happy to answer any questions

**TL:DR** MEH, go to clyde's, expensive go UV instead sophomore year.",2,8,,4csd5v,t3_4csd5v,/r/iastate/comments/4csd5v/how_are_foods_from_isu_dining_hall/d1lcywn/

5727,Comment,Look at the function x^x .  For x>0 this is well defined and has a derivative.  This can be found by noting that x^x =e^(x*ln(x)) .  So we have that the derivative is e^(x*ln(x)) (ln(x)+1)=x^x (ln(x)+1).  If we want to minimize we would set this to 0 which happens when ln(x)+1=0 or ln(x)=-1 or x=e^-1 =1/e which is about 0.367879... so that is the point where it turns around.,0,3,,71yh62,t1_dnyx4c2,/r/iastate/comments/71yh62/i_am_a_steve_butler_ask_me_anything/dnyzt4g/

5732,Post,"As we all know we have to get a negative COVID test within 72hrs of moving in.

I picked the fastest qualifying test option available to me in my area, but yet with 19hrs 23min left in the test window, my sample supposedly ""has not been received at the laboratory.""

If my sample essentially ""expires"" I'll need to get tested again on Saturday, and have my results by Sunday evening for move in.

The best qualifying option I can think of that fits those criteria is the Hilton Coliseum. The only problem is I would need to sleep somewhere for the night. Being a broke college student I could sleep in my car. Not ideal but plan B never is.

I suppose this is on me, should have planned on moving in earlier to allow for a more comfortable plan B.

EDIT: I made a couple of calls and was able to get some stuff resolved. Will be able to move in with a timely manner. Thanks for all you guys chipping in!

5750,Post,"I just finished moving in and completed the COVID testing, so I figured I would share what the process was like for me. Thankfully there weren‚Äôt many people there when I was, so my process may differ from people moving in later. Apologies in advance if there are any spelling/grammar errors in this, as I‚Äôm writing this up on my phone while waiting for food. 

When I arrived at Leid Rec center, I was greeted by some kind workers who told me to get my ID and Confirmation email ready. After entering the building, your temperature will get checked (mine was fine, so I don‚Äôt know what happens if you have a fever), then you will go and scan your ID and give your phone number for the testing kit label. I got super lucky and was able to check in with Wendy.

After finishing all the check-in process, you get taken to a hallway where a bunch of stations set up to get tested. The process was pretty quick; they stick the testing swab up your nose and spin it a few times - don‚Äôt know the exact number of rotations they do. It wasn‚Äôt painful but it felt like I was going sneeze and made my eyes watery. 

After having the test completed, you drop off the testing kit in a bin, then go and get your keys down the hall. When getting the keys to the room, they provided a temp parking pass for moving in, then they listed were to park until the parking passes get handed out. This was the last step to do before going through the exit path, which ISU Dining was set up giving out water bottles, cookies, or an apple. 

The entire process was pretty simple to get through, and there were plenty of people who knew what they were doing to make this process go smoothly.",35,170,0.99,i1de58,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/i1de58/i_just_completed_move_in_and_covid_testing/

When it is super cold / snowing heavily outside, is there a limited food option within Lyon itself or do we have to go out to one of these 3 places? 

  
Finally, if you are a guy who likes pizzas/food, is the gold plan adequate to fill you up or are you going to have to hit the candy machines a couple hours after lunch?

I think the biggest thing is the menu resets every 2 weeks, so after a year of dining center life you'll have tried everything it has to offer. In terms of how it compares to high school lunch, I'd say it's on par (not really better or worse), but you do have more options. For example, if I didn't like what was on the menu that day I could default to cereal, pasta, or salad which were always available. I do recommend having a stash of snacks for when the dining center is not open (early morning and late at night) or don't feel like walking over to one. These can either be purchased via the grace of your parents or most dining plans come with dining dollars you can use at campus convenience stores.

Clubs and student organizations are probably the best way to make friends. Clubfest is the 29th and i highly recommend you walk around and check out every club! The people running the clubs are typically super friendly and will answer any questions you have about what they do. [https://studentengagement.iastate.edu/clubfest](https://studentengagement.iastate.edu/clubfest) . There's a club for every interest, I'm personally fond of the College of Design Art Club and Cosplay Club myself. There are also clubs and communities for all sorts of demographics if you look around. 

  
Go to events! Iowa State University has tons of events to do all the time. AfterDark is an event coming up soon and you can try and talk to people there.

Living in a residence hall is also a big bonus to making friends. Go in common areas or just wander around and see if anyone has their door open.",0,15,,1i7l3t2,t3_1i7l3t2,/r/iastate/comments/1i7l3t2/i_still_need_friends/m8mecbn/

Does anyone here at Iowa State play Rocket League to at least a somewhat competitive level? I would like to be able to form a collegiate team for Iowa State if possible, but can't find anyone that plays the game competitively. Now I'm not looking for die-hard players that live and breathe the game, but at least someone on a Challenger+ level (from Season 3's rankings) that would be interesting in playing against other colleges online in a competitive manner. 

I know of a new organization that is trying to create as many collegiate teams as possible, and they're currently at 18 spread across the US, and I would like to be able to get on that.

Would prefer if you own/play the game on PC, PS4 accepted but not preferred. If you have any questions, feel free to reply to this or PM me.

5847,Comment,"I am a social butterfly so it was easy for me.  I got to know pretty much everyone in the Buchanan building back in 2009 ( I was also a transfer from a community college).  But my first day there, I took the screw out of the top of my door so it could stay open.  Left my door open all the time.  People on my floor and a girl from above (who knew a girl across the hall) stopped by and said high.  Both those girls were 2nd year (one of whom was 21+).  Got to know them, hung out and got drunk in my room with my roommate the 2nd night, became the best of friends (except roommate eventually unfortunately) throughout college.  Always went and had supper/dinner together as a group every evening.  I recommend getting to know people in your dorm.  Go to events they host, put yourself out there if you shy.  People are in the same boat as you. 

When you go and eat and if it‚Äôs busy, ask if you can sit here.  Maybe even try to assess who looks freshmen, odds are they may be in similar boat.  Or at least trying to navigate life of being away from home and their HS friends.  Odds are they will let you and will try to strike up some sort of conversation, even if for awhile.  

If you can, join a club that interest you.  Don‚Äôt even have to attend every single session.  But you will meet cool people that seem cool to you. And eat with them.   I remember once in my history class a girl sat next to me.  We hit it off and became friends.  Asked me if we could grab lunch at Seasons with her friend from her dorm.  Her friend was a girl I went to high school with a few years younger than me.  So you‚Äôd be surprised at the connections you can make.

Grateful Dead once sang: ‚ÄúOnce in a while, you get shown the light, In the strangest of places if you look at it right.‚Äù   I hope this helps, I really do.

\-Jobs: I started tutoring at the beginning of my sophomore year, Now I TA for EE(currently 330) classes. I also have research lined up with a professor(If you are in the first year honors program you have the choice to try to do undergrad research). If you have further questions about these feel free to ask. You can also get a job for CyRide(the bus service) and ISU dining. 

\-ISU has a large engineering career fair. It happens 2 times of year: fall and spring. in these internships are not especially rare once you get to your sophomore year.

\-As someone who is also out-of-state driving home every weekend isn't possible. Its nice every once in a while. It takes alot of planning and work to essentially go home and do no homework for 2 days

Working on CySat is 100% what got me an internship (and then full-time position) at NASA MSFC. I might be in the business of launch vehicles now, but CySat holds a dear place in my heart. Kudos to the team for pushing this across the finish line. My heart definitely skipped a beat when I read that NG-21 had a glitch on the uphill ride, but all is good now.

5895,Comment,"It all has to do with the time of day the bird migrates. Nocturnal migrants are more susceptible to window-collisions at night (because of that whole light attraction thing). Robins migrate during the day so it's not as common during the migration period.

However, Robins do still die from window-collisions (I remember removing a Robin carcass last fall), but those collisions are more common during summer months. This is because there are more young birds, and young birds are more dumb and clumsy. In fact, according to a study, there are more window-collision deaths in July than there are in spring and fall, but it's so hard to conduct a study like this during summer months because of field work obligations (like I will be in Ames, but this sort of study is time intensive so I wouldn't be able to do as much as I want.)

 
During that time, there may be more common species like House Sparrows having window-collisions around campus but no one is around to document it.

I'm hoping that with this study, we will have a better idea of exactly which species are suffering from window-collisions, and potentially extrapolate why.",0,3,,bbzyug,t1_ekn60b0,/r/iastate/comments/bbzyug/if_anyone_remembers_me_asking_about_dead_birds_on/ekn78cz/

Basically I know I have two wisdom teeth coming in for my top set of teeth. Only 2 wisdom teeth for me! YAY! 

Was supposed to see an orthodontist during winter break, however they no longer take my insurance which is medicaid, they were sweet enough to tell me the day before my appt of this change. I stupidity stopped thinking about it as about a year ago was when I began to feel pain associated with the wisdom teeth. However, by the time of my supposed appt, the pain had subside. Thought I was in the clear. 

Well starting yesterday I noticed that one of the areas where one wisdom tooth might come out was tender. I didn't think much of it, during my morning brush I saw my toothbrush had a bit of blood but I that whatever for some reason. 

Tonight when I brushed my teeth I went over the tender area, without thinking. Blood came out, it wasn't gushing out but I was alarmed at the amount. When I rinsed my mouth with water it came out red. It took a few minutes of rinsing for the water to turn clear.

I panicked. I googled. Obviously this isn't normal but everytime I call a denist office and they hear what my insurance is they say they won't see me. I've even offered to pay with money. I'm not sure what to do, the only places that accept my insurance are community centers that offer dentistry, if I'm not wrong there like 2 in the state of Iowa. I don't have a car, and if it is something like having to get my wisdom teeth removed I don't know any orthodontist that would accept my insurance.

Is there really no place I can go? I know im not dying or anything but the blood just freaked me out. Can dentist really just turn me away? Does anyone know what I can do? My concerns with community centers are the distance and the wait list, one of them I called over break and they where booked for a few months. I willing to pay out of pocket to seen. üòñüò£

Edit: I want to give thanks to everyone who commented! I made an appt with Primary Care as they are cheaper and close by. 

However, I'm glad to know that there are many options, some that take medicaid or others like Somerset that won't turn me away!

Honestly, I was really discouraged because I had been turned away so many times, I guess I called everyone who didn't take my insurance first, lol. Thanks again everyone!

There is a lot of resources on campus that undergraduates have not made use of, the university needs to do a better job of advertising programs such as SI, Make to innovate, and research opportunities.

6024,Post,"So over the past six months or so my father and I have been discussing capitalism(C), socialism(S), and communism(Co).  He very much believes in capitalism thinking that socialism and communism are very bad forms of government.  Looked like I hit him with Abrams tank when I proposed that capitalism, socialism, and communism are all economic models with the later two not actually being governing models.

So let me lay out an argument here.  All three economic models can survive in a democracy or republic form of government.  I will also later talk about how I see each one fitting best with a particular form of government.

So lets lay out a basic understanding of the three models:
C: Individual citizens (of some society) control the means of production and reap the rewards of the company.
S: The workers of a society control the means of production and reap the rewards of their company.
Co: The government controls the means of production and reaps the rewards of the companies.
(Note that society in this is a very ambiguous term and can be anything from local communities to the global community.)

So being economic models and not governance models C, S, and Co can all exist in our current for of democratic republic.  C strives to stimulate economic growth through the law of supply and demand.  That is the more workers there are the lower the demand for a worker is thus the lower the wage is and conversely the fewer workers there are the higher the wages should be (I won't get into the semantics of is this actually what is happening).  This is true for the products that are being sold also.  High supply and low demand means low prices while low supply and high demand means high prices.  There is nothing innate to C that makes it unable to function in a democracy or republic.

S is an interesting case because in practice I don't believe we have ever actually seen this economic model implemented.  We tend to see either C or Co.  How ever in practice this economic model actually would function more closely to a democracy than any other model in the fact that it requires the input of all workers when decisions need made.  Now this isn't to say that you need an unanimous agreement among workers to implement a new work place policies or that one worker can shut down the system.  There are still social rules that must be followed.  They just may be different than the ones we follow today.

Co is the other major economic model have seen emerge in the world.  Where the government controls the production and reaps the rewards.  Again this isn't innately a bad system.  The problem that we have seen is this system only really has been used under autocratic or fascist regimes so we tend to fear it.  If we as a people set up rules for how a government using this model is to conduct itself and what it is to do with the spoils of the companies it controls there is no reason that this form of economy could not function in a democracy or republic.

So a quick run down of what type of government I think each would flourish under and you are free to agree or disagree this is purely opinion and speculation.
C: This doesn't really flourish under any sort of government.  It relies solely on supply and demand as its driving force.  Any sort of government would only function to regulate this mechanic and in doing so move the economic model more towards one of the other two economic models
S: This would be the ultimate exercise in democracy.  While democracy is too slow to work in large scale societies each company actually functions as a much smaller society so issues still could be resolved in a timely manner.
Co: This would work best in a republic.  As I have already said on the scale of which Co works democracy isn't a functional option.  You would have to shrink down the number of decisions makers and the best way to do that is for people to elect other people who they think will best represent their interests in that process.

So have at me.  Give me something new to think about.",14,0,0.26,7a44zc,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/7a44zc/something_to_think_about/

6035,Post,"I live in SUV and been buying a mix of meal blocks and some dining dollars for the past few semesters which worked perfectly for a random lunch on campus and a few things from the C-Store here and there, but then started to really think about it. 



When using a meal for Froots, Hawthorne or Clyde's, you're actually loosing money every time. I used to buy a 50 meal block, which was roughly $10.50 a meal, but a typical bundle at Clyde's or Hawthorne is like $8-$9, so you're losing ~$2 every meal you use. When using a bundle for Froots, you're spending $10.50 on a $6 smoothie, losing even more. The only instance where you're not losing money would be at Seasons/UDCC/Conversations where a meal cost $11 but if you buy enough Dining Dollars, you get a discount though, so even that evens out for the same cost.



So overall, you're going to save money on pretty much any meal bundle you use, have more freedom for your meals (Don't have to get 2 sides or can get whatever you want from the C-Store for a ""side"" instead for pretty much same price), and have the ability to use those extra dining dollars on whatever the hell you want.




In this post I use estimates, but I actually spent some time going through the actual numbers comparing a 50 meal block to equivalent dining dollars and the math checks out. This might not be true for the 25 meal blocks, but it should be even if anything. Also, the prices for blocks/DD can change so this might not be true for future years. Double check the math if you're hesitant and you should come to the same conclusion, just trying to help people out with this advice.",7,42,0.99,5797mz,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/5797mz/for_those_of_you_buying_meal_blocks_dont_buy/

6064,Post,"###Welcome back!

Hello all, hope you had a great summer! I figured it's about time that I post a Fall update for CyRide. 

For the new people here that don't know me: I'm Mike and I'm a Transit Dispatcher at CyRide, and I'm coming up on my 7th year here. Me and my fellow dispatchers take care of a lot of the stuff behind the scenes that you normally wouldn't think about when riding CyRide, such as detour creation, policy implentation, and in general just ensuring the system runs the way it's scheduled to run.

---
###WE'RE HIRING!

I normally wouldn't lead with this, but we are incredibly short staffed this year. To put the severity of it into context, no employee that works here has ever seen it this bad, even the ones that have been here for 30+ years. If you want to drive for CyRide, starting wage is $16.96/hr with a signing bonus*  and other added benefits include paid vacation and sick time, IPERS retirement, and much more that I can't throw into a paragraph. We also provide CDL training, so all you need is a valid drivers license to apply and we'll train you how to do the rest.

If any of the above sounds enticing and you'd like to come work with me, apply [here](https://www.governmentjobs.com/careers/cityofames/jobs/3128267/transit-driver?page=2&pagetype=jobOpportunitiesJobs), and feel free to mention me as a referall!

^*a ^new ^bonus ^was ^just ^approved ^by ^the ^board ^last ^night ^- ^details ^are ^currently ^being ^ironed ^out ^with ^HR ^so ^I'm ^not ^at ^liberty ^to ^say ^the ^exact ^amount, ^but ^it's ^significant. 

---
###Fall Schedule

Alright, on to the important stuff! Fall schedule begins Monday, August 16th. We will be running a modified break [schedule](https://www.cyride.com/schedules/school-year-schedule/weekdays) which means that some routes won't run (cardinal, lilac), some routes will have reduced service (orange, gold, cherry, plum) and and all shaded lines on the printed schedule won't run. This first week before classes is always fun to figure out, so if you're not sure feel free to give us a call and we can help you out.

Additionally, Moonlight Express WILL be operational on Friday the 20th and Saturday the 21st, but see the Moonlight section below for changes to service.  

On Monday August 23rd, we will begin full service and all routes will be running until ISU break days come.

---

###Moonlight Express/MLX

Moonlight is going to be a little bit different this year. Ridership has been declining significantly over the last few years even before COVID, and we've been slowly recalibrating it each year to adjust for the declining ridership. 

There will only be two shuttles for MLX this year - the **A shuttle**, which is a fixed route that runs from Ames Middle School to ~~S. 5th and Duff~~ Lincoln Way and Beach* , and the **E shuttle** which is a door to door service that services everything the A shuttle can't. To arrange for a ride on the E shuttle, give CyRide a call after 9pm on Friday and Saturday to arrange a pickup. *(Notable pickup locations for the E shuttle are Shilliter Village/SUV, Freddy court, Somerset, Ontario, Copper Beach/Grove, and South Duff.)*

Using the data we've collected, we've reduced service on the A shuttle to a 24 minute timetable, which is an increase of 4 minutes from last year and slightly modified the route. There will be no B,C, or D shuttles for the time-being and the E shuttle will absorb everywhere else in Ames. Please note that the moonlight section on the CyRide website is not currently accurate as this decision was just finalized yesterday, but it will for sure be posted before next Friday.

* **Updated 8/18** - Moonlight route has been modified to turn around at ISC and service Ames Middle School to Lincoln Way & Beach
---
###Detours

Fortunately, construction season is coming to an end. There are some minor detours around town that shouldn't really disrupt service. 

One notable short-term detour for Orange will be in effect ~~Monday, August 16th and hopefully ending Thursday, August 19th.~~ Monday, August 23rd and hopefully ending Thursday, August 26th.* Northbound travel on Beach north of Lincoln Way will not be possible for Orange route during these days, so those of you at MWL (Maple, Willow, Larch) will need to catch Orange at Lincoln Way and Beach Eastbound during these days. The detour map is not up yet, but make sure to check the rider alerts on the CyRide website when it does go into effect.

* **Updated 8/18** - FPM at ISU informed us they are pushing the construction back a week, so we're going to have some fun this first full week of classes.
---
###Staffing/Extras

Even with our staffing issues, we're going to be doing everything in our power to make sure you get a ride to class. All of CyRide administration and dispatch are also planning on driving where we're short. You will probably see drivers that aren't wearing the standard CyRide uniform - that will be admin or dispatch!

That being said, we won't be able to provide the same amount of extra buses (buses that assist the regularly scheduled bus for capacity issues) that we had in the past. In order to be guaranteed a ride, you may need to catch an earlier bus to get to class on time. However, if certain routes are consistently overloading we will try our best to accommodate as the semester progresses.

---
###COVID/Masks

Due to a [federal mandate](https://www.transit.dot.gov/TransitMaskUp), masks are still required on all CyRide buses. ~~This is set to expire on September 13th, but with rising cases I wouldn't be shocked if it gets extended further.~~

**Updated 8/18** - Federal mask mandate now extended to January 18th, 2022.

We are running very low on masks that we can provide, and from what I know we will not be able to supply anymore once we run out. Please make sure you bring your mask with you if you're going to be riding the bus!

2 Bed / 1.5 Bath. (Half bath inside the master bedroom)
~900 sq. ft. (Living room, galley kitchen, dining area off kitchen, sizable patio, across the hall storage, and the two bedrooms.)
Wood burning fire place
As mentioned before - large patio attached to apartment.
I smoke occasionally, always on the patio. 
Comes with fully furnished kitchen.
PET FRIENDLY with deposit + $30 a month per cat / dog.

6211,Comment,"I think looking at the previous finals is always a good strategy.  There will very likely be a special review session as well and some practice finals that are made.  If so these will be designed with secret hidden messages that when solved backwards will spell out that ""Math is cool"".

Actually the practice problems will contain most of the ideas that we want you to know but spread and obfuscated through several problems, which when we say if you can do these problems you will be OK means that if you can use the tools required to solve these problems you will be OK.

Bonus advice:  Make a regular habit of about once per week to go through and do a quick summary overview of what we have done so far and one or two random problems from old finals.  The consistency of review and practice will make the material seem almost second nature.",0,1,,71yh62,t1_dni4zk0,/r/iastate/comments/71yh62/i_am_a_steve_butler_ask_me_anything/dnibrg5/

6267,Comment,"I am a student supervisor that works for ISU Dining and I have talked with plenty of other students in my position and managerial positions about this topic. You are correct to think that ISU Dining has become more of a scam than anything. 

ISU Dining used to be a service when I was a freshman. It was easy, had a wide variety of plans, and dining centers were on a monthly schedule of food options. 

A few years ago, administration and management changed in the higher up forms and this is when ISU Dining became a business to cut costs and stopped being a service to students. 

Like you said in your post, bundles disappeared, third party food options were abandoned for ISU themed venues, and plans became convoluted. 

Students that live in the dorm are required to get a meal plan and that makes ISU Dining the monopoly for food options for a large portion of the student body. 

If you think this is a problem, you need to speak out because this is extorting* students for every penny and providing the bear minimum. Future students should not have to experience this and ISU Dining needs to remember that they should be a service for the student, not a business to get every penny.

6269,Comment,"How did you not know this before you moved in ü§¶ü§¶üßò

It should *not* be a surprise that her dorm doesn't have AC, or that there's no dining hall in the building. All of that info is very clearly stated online. On your room assignment, it says in, big, clear text, ""No AC."" Have you never looked at your room assignment page on starrez????? 

(Also, having a room with AC will cost you a few hundred more. It's an upcharge. You can just use a couple fans and open the window. It's only for a few weeks). 

And every single dorm has a floorplan map online, plus there are campus maps online that show every single dining location. Pretty easy to find out how close you are to dining locations. 

Not to mention ‚ú®you could have changed your dorm‚ú® if you didn't like it. There's a crazy easy room swap process on starrez, and instructions on how to do it are online. It may be too late now though, because you were supposed to do this stuff months ago. You can manually choose exactly what room you want/in what building, as long as the room is open (it will show you open rooms). 

There may still be room change options available, but I'm unsure what that process would look like this close to the start of the year, or if anything would be available. You would have to research that elsewhere.

I personally will treat myself once a weekend, there's quite a few places on Lincoln way you can try out and the buses make it easier to get to some other places. But that option will vary depending on the person of course.

2) Pros and Cons of Dinning dollars

3) How much does it cost to buy a meal at all the dining halls with dining dollars

6298,Comment,"To clarify - ISU is not planning on building 2 new gas boilers.  The plan is to take 2 existing coal fired boilers, remove the coal equipment, and convert the existing boilers to burn gas.  This can be done in two years to get ISU off of coal. 

Natural gas is not good, just better than coal.  Better is better than no change.  There is no possible course of action that would completely take ISU off of fossil fuels in 2 years. 

The $16 million to convert the boilers does not lock ISU into anything.  Full decarbonization of campus will cost hundreds of millions of dollars. The 16 for this stopgap will be lost in the couch cushions of the full project. 

But I support your overall cause.  Climate change is real and renewables are the future.  There is no reason not to make the switch as rapidly as possible.  And the only way that will happen is public pressure and a change of state government.   So pressure away!  (But I think that stopping this baby step improvement is counter productive as canceling it would leave us on coal.)",1,95,,pp2955,t1_hd0op2o,/r/iastate/comments/pp2955/the_voices_of_students_were_silenced_today_by_the/hd179zn/

I‚Äôm moving into my new apartment near West Hy-Vee in Ames this August and I‚Äôm on the lookout for some budget-friendly second-hand furniture. I‚Äôm a new student and don‚Äôt have a car, so I‚Äôm really hoping to find someone who can help with delivery.

‚Ä¢Foldable queen bed frame  
‚Ä¢Sofa(preferably not too bulky)  
‚Ä¢Table(for study or dining, multifunctional would be awesome)

I'm not a civil engineer, so I am really hesitant to get out of my lane and speculate on whether it's more energy-efficient than other systems.

If you are serious about finding a way to give these meals to houseless people or those in need of a meal, I would reach out to Food at First.

I was considering purchasing some dining dollars so I don‚Äôt always have to go back to my apartment for lunch. This way I could stay on campus and work on homework or do other things. Does anyone who has lived off campus have experience purchasing dining dollars in the past for quick lunches or snacks? If so, was worth the cost?

So eating on campus wouldn‚Äôt be an every day thing by any means, maybe once or twice a week.

6378,Comment,"I'll be at the career fair again this year recruiting for the company I work for. If you guys have questions around anything related, feel free to ask. Throwaway for the same reason as last year - my opinions aren't cleared through my HR department.

&#x200B;

OP's Points

**Pre-game:**

1. Absolutely valid points. If we're interested in interviewing you, we will find your linkedin if you have one, and your resume will be handed to the interviewers. You won't go wrong spending some time polishing both.
2. Yep, this is good advice too. I will say that there are enough people that we typically aren't paying attention to who is wandering vs going to straight to a booth. That may just be us, given we always have enough of a line that we don't have time to pay attention to ambient students. It's perfectly reasonable to look at who is there, and to do some research day-of.
3. You should wear a suit, or spend some time figuring out something that would feel comfortable going to a formal dinner in. A normal button-up with khakis will seem under-dressed, and will require a more stellar interview to get you in the door. Once you're in the door with the company, you can dress down a bit - even if you're not in college you show up to interviews in a suit or formal attire. Women have more leeway here than men. Sorry guys, that's life.

**During the fair:**

1. Yes. Never talk to a recruiter at the same time as someone else. It's very difficult for us to figure out who is actually applying, and chances are your success will be tied to the whoever does worse. If you do want to go with your buddy and both apply, you should talk to the recruiter one at a time. I've had people try to ""pair interview"" several times per year, and it never ends well for them.
2. No. We want you to give us a 15-30 second speech telling us why you're interested in *us*, and why you want to apply to *us*. If you use the same speech for every company, you look like you've done no research.
3. Yes. Non-verbal is important. Engineering career fair will get away with a lower bar for this than business, but for business you're being analyzed on how well you will interact with stakeholders, and non-verbals are very important to that.
4. Yes. We don't want to pack it back to the office, we wind up with loads of it. It's neither a pro nor a con to take swag, but we're very happy to give it to you.
5. Yes. We will ask you to apply online (Iowa state wants us to), but we also expect you to have a resume, otherwise we don't know what questions to ask you. We also typically use your resume to take notes on how you did on the interview. We'll have hundreds of resumes, so we need to take notes to remember you.
6. Eh. You can, most companies will not give this to you. We explicitly don't bring business cards for our folks to the career fair. You're either talking to recruiters (at which point they won't be able to give you a ton of info about exactly what life at the company is like), or you're talking to actual senior employees (at which point they don't want to be inundated by attempts to get an interview). Don't take it as a negative if they won't give this to you.
7. Careful here... very careful.  Being outgoing is good, but don't fake your resume. We *will* find out at some point. You *may* make it to an interview, but we'll find out there, and that's assuming that our recruiters don't find out during your 60 seconds with them. People who are honest about where their strengths are on their resume are much preferred to people who say ""I have X experience!"" and it turns out that it's either extremely shallow or not at all. Being too fake will pretty much instantly disqualify you. So be outgoing (even if you're a bit of an introvert), yes, but don't try to fake your skills.

6379,Comment,"This guy right here is your best answer. It's like a 3-10 min mini interview where everyone is sorting out if they want to interview you more in-depth. Keep in mind the average company is going to get 100-200 resumes, and probably has time to interview 10-20 at max. 

The elevator speech is your chance to highlight all your points you want to talk about. Personal projects, key skill you have that are rarer, that kind of thing. Something the recruiter can follow up on in questions. They're going to narrow in on what's unique to you (if they're good at their job) so drive the conversation.

And, as above poster said, google the employer on your phone while you're waiting in line.

I'm saying the additional source of food that you say will make up the difference (free pizza, beer, etc.) will not be enough to make up the difference. (And if anything will cost more because apparently the grocery is off limits)

The most any plan has is $300. That would buy you coffee for roughly every school day. Which is not a lot.

All though I'll admit that 21 or 17 meals per week is excessive for most people.

Although if you realize you don't need 17 meals per week and you have that many, maybe be smart and start hoarding to go meals, so you don't waste money and you have snack food.",1,0,,4csd5v,t1_d1lft2b,/r/iastate/comments/4csd5v/how_are_foods_from_isu_dining_hall/d1lgrno/

6397,Comment,"I just graduated this December. My freshman year was 2019-2020. I started in the dorms and my first semester was fairly normal. I made some friends on my dorm floor and realized I hated my major and ended up switching half way through the semester. I hated my roommate and she moved out at semester and a friend moved in which was cool, but then we went to spring break and never came back. I stayed with my bf at his parents house because my parents are a lot older/immune compromised. That was actually so chill. I was in the design core and in the drawing class. I just chilled in my bf‚Äôs basement and spent basically all my time drawing which was lowkey therapeutic for me. 

Fall 2020 My bf and I moved into an apartment with the friend who was my second dorm roommate and two of her friends. Unfortunately they turned out to be shitty friends and would talk shit behind my back. I had all my classes online so lowkey I should‚Äôve just stayed at my bf‚Äôs/my parents‚Äô house and done school online. My bf and I moved in with my sister and her bf at semester. The two month long winter break was so sick honestly. It was such a chill time to move. I did get COVID for the first time the week of thanksgiving that year so my bf‚Äôs sisters brought us leftover thanksgiving food and left it on our porch which was sweet. Spring semester 2021 I had a couple hybrid classes which felt a little weird to go back to pre-vaccine imo. 

Fall 2021 was pretty much back to normal. I was in my design program and everything was in-person and very hands-on. I was living in ankeny with my bf and sister and her bf so I was driving back and forth everyday which was a little annoying. If I could do it again I would definitely live closer to campus. Being so far away made it hard to hang out with people and spend time with friends. January 2022 I got COVID again right before classes started and I missed the first week. Other than that the semester was chill but I was still driving back and forth from ankeny which was annoying. 

Fall 2022 my bf and I moved to the apartment we‚Äôre still at in Ames. We live kinda far from campus but was closer than ankeny lol and we wanted to live in a chill apartment without a bunch of loud neighbors and parties all the time which definitely worked out. Fall 2022/spring 2023 were chill and I started to actually really hang out with friends outside of class for the first time. 

Fall 2023 was my last semester and was kind of intense. I would not recommend taking 18 credits your last semester if you‚Äôre in a design major where you have to focus on a senior project. But hey I graduated and that‚Äôs all that matters. 

I feel like overall my college experience wasn‚Äôt super typical due to COVID affecting such a large part of it, especially in the beginning. I didn‚Äôt get to really solidify friendships early on. I do have good friends now, but I do wish I was able to get closer to them earlier. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve had my boyfriend this whole time because without him I would have been so incredibly lonely. I was still kind of lonely in a friend way for a while which sucks but it is what it is. I learned to be comfortable with myself and independent which is a good thing. Sometimes I wish I had a more ‚Äútypical‚Äù experience but other times I‚Äôm grateful for the unique experience I had and what I gained from it.",0,8,,18vnz68,t3_18vnz68,/r/iastate/comments/18vnz68/covid_memories/kfss1b8/
6398,Post,"Hey, everyone! Your fellow bird nerd here.

I've posted a couple times over the past year about how windows kill birds via collisions, and how I've received funding earlier this year to look into how our campus impacts migratory bird populations.

I've gotten a biology professor and a handful of freshmen biology/animal ecology students to help me monitor some buildings here on campus, which is very exciting. Personally, I'll be looking at some buildings on the west side of campus almost every day of the week (so if you see someone skulking around a building and picking up dead birds from the sidewalk, stop by and say hi!). We will be monitoring specific buildings to provide an estimation of how many birds ISU buildings kill over the course of the annual migrations.

However! We have permits to collect any specimens in Iowa! If you spot a dead bird on campus that seems to be in good condition (i.e. the body is intact), please comment here or shoot me a PM! The specimens will be donated back to the university and used for educational purposes!

Other benefits of me collecting the bodies include:

* you and your fellow students won't have to look at as many dead birds on your way to class

* it lowers the number of scavengers on our campus

* it may help us make Iowa State a bird-friendly campus in the future

And before anyone mentions it: yes, we will be monitoring that new building on the west side of campus once construction is complete in 2020.

Don't hesitate to ask me questions about this important issue!

edit: on/near central campus is preferred, since I am storing the specimens in Bessey Hall.",16,37,1.0,d11xv4,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/d11xv4/tell_me_about_the_dead_birds_you_see_on_campus/

I post a fair amount of materials online and have a reputation for giving hard tests (and have written a nontrivial number of recent calculus finals).  So people who are interested in how calculus is run at Iowa State might want to talk to me.

On a side note I also do fun stuff, for example juggling, and card shuffling (I can do eight perfect shuffles in a row and can show you why that is awesome).

As to the question about a hot dog, I would point out that it is now a matter of settled law that a [burrito is not a sandwich](http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/11/10/massachusetts-judge-settles-dispute-by-ruling-burrito-is-not-sandwich.html).  And if a burrito is not a sandwich I don't think we should consider a hot dog one as well.

Whichever one is nearest to you.  Unfortunately I have not been in the majority of the buildings on campus and even fewer restrooms, so I am not expert enough to say what is **the** best place on campus.

Also, we're ~30-45 minutes away from Des Moines, so if there's anything that you can't do in Ames, there's probably a 99% chance you'll be able to do it in Des Moines, which is easy to get to


Another thing about Ames is Cyride. It's hands down one of the best bus systems in the country. Buses usually come within +/- 2 minutes of the times mentioned on the time table for that route so Cyride is super reliable and reaches pretty much any area in town you'd want to go to, including all of campus

Ames has a couple of movie theaters. We have a pretty diverse selection of chain and local restaurants. Central campus is very nice.

6426,Post,"Four years ago convos had espresso machines, there were 3 sides per meal bundle, there were no such things as ‚Äúflex‚Äù meals, a meal swipe was a meal swipe. 

The next year they removed the espresso machines from convos, made meal bundles jump down to 2 sides per meal.

The next year they introduced flex meals - 35 per semester and the unlimited plans, while raising the prices of all the meal plans.

This year they lowered the amount of express meals, removed caribou, destroyed froots selection and renaming it ‚Äúwhirlybirds‚Äù, and lowered the amount of flex meals yet again, while introducing a cyflex plan for those who relied on flex meals.

Meal plans were pretty simple, a swipe was a swipe anywhere.  If you wanted to buy something that was a bundle, you‚Äôd use your dining dollars.

Now there‚Äôs a lot of confusion, swiping in a friend subtracts from your dining dollars, limited flex meals, less amounts of food from bundles, and more.

So how does ISU lose money from this?  There are many meals that are left over from the fold plans at end of semesters.

Let me follow up with this: *This post is* ***not*** *an exhaustive list of resources and services, but I think they tend to be the most helpful for new students*. That being said, there are **tons** of resources that won't be covered in this post. Many of them are available here: [https://cyclonesupport.iastate.edu/support-resources](https://cyclonesupport.iastate.edu/support-resources)

Also a disclaimer: Because I don't want to get sued or something, I should say that this post is **not** sponsored or approved by Iowa State, and while I went to great effort to ensure the information is correct, it could be incorrect. It also is not medical or legal advice.

6514,Post,"###Welcome to 2021!

Hello everyone, and welcome back! Hopefully 2021 is a better year for you all than last year. We've all been through a lot, and I think it's safe to say that everyone is ready for things to be back to normal (fingers crossed for Fall 2021!) There's not really much new to share except a few key things, but just figured I'd keep everyone in the loop at what's going on with CyRide for this Spring. 

---
###Regular service resumes on Monday, 1/25/2021

Normal service will resume on Monday, 1/25, and Moonlight Express will resume on Friday, 1/29. Please keep in mind that we will still run a full break schedule for the week of the 18th, so the please keep the following in mind for next week:

* #21 Cardinal, #11 Cherry, #12 Lilac will not run until Monday, 1/25
* #23 Orange and #9 Plum will have reduced service until Monday, 1/25 *(other routes also have some reduced service, but the impact is minimal. Look for the shaded lines on the printed schedule - those do not run over breaks.)*
* #25 Gold will follow it's break schedule **and route** until Monday, 1/25.

---
###This one is important: #21 Cardinal and #23 Orange routes are back on regular route!

For nearly the past two years, #21 Cardinal and #23 Orange routes were on a detour due to the Gerdin Business Building expansion which resulted in the Wallace Road closure. Construction was completed right when ISU went on Winter Break. For some of you, you may only know the detour version of these routes. If you're not familiar with the correct routes, you may want to brush up. [Here](https://www.cyride.com/Home/ShowDocument?id=9451) is the map of Cardinal's regular route, and [Here](https://www.cyride.com/Home/ShowDocument?id=9435) is Orange's regular route. Please note that Cardinal no longer goes down Morrill road, and Orange no longer goes on Union Drive by the President's house.

---

### #3 Blue Route/South 5th Street

Blue route has also been impacted by construction for quite a while, resulting in the Blue route having to completely bypass South 5th Street. That construction was also completed over break, so we're back on route. However, due to the nature of the road construction, the South Meadows stop and shelter will be permanently closed. Riders that used to use the South Meadows stop will either need to catch the bus at the stops at River Birch or South Walnut.

---

###Moonlight Express

As stated above, MLX resumes on Friday, 1/29. If you're not up to date with the changes to Moonlight express, we've limited fixed-route service to the A Shuttle which services West Ames and East Ames at Duff on 20 minute timetable.

For all other areas, the E shuttle is available, which is basically a late night dial-a-ride. Give CyRide a call any time after 10:00pm (Fridays and Saturdays only) to schedule a pickup and a minibus will be dispatched to your location as soon as possible (including, but not limited to: Ontario Street, Somerset, Schilleter/University Village, Freddy Court, Towers, Research Park/Wessex, Copper Beach/The Grove, and South Duff.) For more information, [the Moonlight Express page](https://www.cyride.com/schedules/school-year-schedule/moonlight-express) on our website should give you the most up to date maps and timetables.

---
###CyRide in inclement weather conditions

With a winter snow storm approaching here in a couple of hours, I figured it would be appropriate to include this, especially because it appears that we're going to have a late winter. CyRide has historically almost never cancelled service due to severe weather conditions. I think there was one instance before my time where we cancelled for one day because the roads were a solid sheet of ice, but other than that we don't really cancel unless it's absolutely necessary for the safety of both drivers and passengers. While rare, it is possible that service is suspended until conditions improve like we've done in the past with flash floods.

**However,** when conditions are severe enough, you should expect late buses and/or missed trips. We will most likely not be guaranteeing transfers if buses start running late. Please keep this in mind if you're planning on riding, and try to catch an earlier bus if you have an appointment. 

The best way you can stay up to date is by following our website, Facebook, and Twitter accounts. We will generally update them if any changes to service occur due to weather disruptions.

---

###Obligatory COVID update

Though nothing has really changed with our policy, I still feel that it's important to share. Our mask policy has not changed, our drivers are still disinfecting the buses with a peroxide solution when they have down time, and our laneworkers are still completely spraying down the buses at the end of service. When the weather gets a bit nicer, we'll start opening the windows and roof hatches to maximize fresh airflow through the buses.

---

###TL;DR

**TL;DR:** Regular service resumes on Monday, 1/25. During the week of 1/18 be aware of changed service to some routes due to break schedule. Wallace Road is open; #21 and #23 are back on regular route. South Meadows stop closed on Blue Route on South 5th Street. Moonlight express starts 1/29, call if you need a ride if you're outside the A shuttle service zone. For inclement weather, CyRide will most likely still run, but buses might be late. Finally, COVID policy is the same as last year.

6527,Post,"Hey r/iastate,

I‚Äôm just sitting here reminiscing about my career and education and just want to share some of my knowledge (and write for myself too). No advice or ‚Äúwisdom‚Äù really but just a story for those who will stay and read. I see a lot of anxious posts on here and it reminds me of me a lot.

I graduated almost 4 years ago, Mechanical Engineering. I was a pretty high achieving student but I had no internal direction throughout my entire college career. I didn‚Äôt know what I wanted to do with my degree or my life, really. I just knew that I was attaining lots of debt that I would have to find a real job to pay it off, and I wanted to do it comfortably, so ideally a job that my degree is actually for, in the engineering field where mu‚Äôffas pay pretty well.

I had a lot of anxiety about creating my resume, going to the career fair and talking to recruiters... even talking to other engineering students about their interviews, offers and internships gave me a lot of anxiety too. I felt like I was way out of my comfort zone while I saw others who seemed to totally take it all in stride. (P.S. that‚Äôs really not the case)

Even down to my senior year, during my last semester, I had no idea what I was doing or where I would be after I graduated. That time, I went balls out at the career fair and just sold my heart out. Handed out resumes and talked to dozens of companies. I had real ((existential)) anxiety that day, but there were some companies that I actually had real interest in, so it made it a bit easier. That‚Äôs the key, I took the time (away from my class work honestly) and did the research and really pictured myself being a part of whatever they did.

Everyone seems to think the real deal is going to companies like Boeing, Caterpillar, Microsoft, Target, whatever. Just no. The real deal is exactly whatever YOU need in YOUR career and YOUR life. You are put under pressure by your advisors and professors etc. to go a certain route because of your degree and excel in finding well paying jobs and going to ‚Äúelite‚Äù companies to boast to incoming students. And they aren‚Äôt rookies at it, just look at the fucking place. Iowa State is booming.

I was looking for a smaller company in a larger city. I decided that pursuing those larger companies was more like buying a lottery ticket, and it basically is for a lot of these companies unless you know someone and can get referred. If you can get referred and prove yourself in the company, congratulations, honestly lol.

Guess what. On my last career fair, I got a call back from the #1 company on my list. And the 30 minute phone interview turned into 90 minutes. And the 3 hour on site interview felt like a chat with my roommate or some shit. The job offer came shortly after. I was so relieved, flabbergasted, filled with joy and hope again, that I knew what I was going to be doing and I was genuinely excited.

These days I still work for that company and it‚Äôs just as exciting as Day 1. I have been promoted every year (w/ pay increases of course) and now I really have it made with my current agreement.

I am no longer in any debt and I‚Äôm very pleased with my career, and I feel it‚Äôs something that I‚Äôll be doing for the rest of my life. I am only 26 and I‚Äôm managing my own little team and own the hell out of my projects. The people I work with are brilliant, I have a great relationship with the management and the CEO knows me by name.

And I‚Äôm totally myself in my work too. I‚Äôm gay, heavily tattooed and smoke weed every day lol. Life is amazing.

You know, I guess if there‚Äôs a lesson to be learned, it‚Äôs that sometimes shit just falls into place. Even if it feels like it never might. You just have to keep going. Take the rejections. It makes you stronger!

Anyway, back to the career fair thing, the following year after I graduated, the tables turned and I became the recruiter. And I was the one taking the resumes and had students lined up to talk to me.

Basically, the ones who caught my attention were the ones who showed genuine interest. It‚Äôs really more about the spark in your eye more than what you say. That can be a tough reality for some to face, but what I really want to see is less prepared speeches and more real conversation. And be real, tell me what scares you about the company, ask what the office environment is like, the current and upcoming projects that you could be working on, what do I do day to day... seriously, take some time and put yourself at that company in your head - you will come up with the right questions that I and other recruiters want to hear.

I also give interviews, and have given many more interviews than I have taken at this point lol. Again, it‚Äôs more about genuine interest - but also if they‚Äôre the right fit.

In recruiting, a lot of times in my own experience, it‚Äôs not for finding who is the smartest and most achieved (or even experienced) candidates. It‚Äôs for whatever position is open and we have to fill it (to be able to complete projects on time, not all companies are like this).

Ultimately in every company, recruiting is about finding the right fit. Even though you might walk in with a bright smile, keep eye contact, have a firm handshake, great posture, speak well and sharp, the other candidate with the same skills got the job because he mentioned that he liked to sketch buildings or whatever as a kid and always dreamed of blah blah blah. The people who are actually interested in the specifics of what we do are the ones who get in.


Coming full circle, the one thing that I know I did right was I decided to be myself no matter what. No fake smiles. No practiced speeches. Only real questions, because this is real life and I would be living a good solid chunk of my real life at whatever place I ended up at. Fuck making my parents or community or advisors happy, they aren‚Äôt the ones living my life, I am. But in the end, everyone was happy anyway. Shit dude.

Well shout out to you for making it down here, to me you are a real one and I see you. Keep those chins up, you go to a school with a great reputation (at least in my field).

TL:DR - Don‚Äôt worry, be happy",1,52,0.97,cdqfrr,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/cdqfrr/some_peace_of_mind_from_an_alumnus_and_recruiter/

6565,Comment,"Op thanks for posting this. It's very therapeutic to read all these posts and relate so much to everyone. Literally, everyone was going through it during COVID-19, and I truly wonder what will happen to society in the future because of social distancing. 

Here is my story. Preface I'm now one semester from being an Aerospace Engineer (2019-2024) and I was on a four year full ride scholarship. Covid-19 social distancing happened during my freshman year. First semester I was able to make friends, experience weed and alcohol for the first time a lot of the ‚Äúcollege experience‚Äù. I created a regiment for myself to stay on track went to the gym, went to class, and got on the dean's list freshman year. Spring I was on track to do the same. Then social distancing happened. My regiment went out the window.

I grew up being homeschooled but it was honestly very weird to go back home and do school. I was an adult now I didn't have a nagging parent so basically I ignored school, stopped doing homework, gamed all day, lost track of time, and passed my classes that semester either because I passed/failed them or there was a huge curve. I had signed a lease with my freshman roommate (also aerospace) in the Spring so the fall semester I was back in Ames. I also did the exact same thing I did the previous semester but applied myself somewhat or so I thought. I was placed on academic probation; my roommate though didn't apply himself and got on academic warning. This is kind of where all the mental illness shit started to happen. 

My roommate and I helped each other understand the classes we were taking we would discuss things and we would kind of help each other learn. Once he got an academic warning he stopped applying himself. He would only ever game and would never come out of his room. I felt I was taking the hardest engineering course by myself. I didn't know anyone else that was in aero besides my roommate. I also essentially lost my only friend at the time because he wouldn't socialize at all only game. I truly felt alone and sad and depressed. Even though I'm an engineer I love socializing and making friends.

I tried to hang out with my neighbors but I didn't feel invited or wanted. I felt out of place like I was forcing myself into companionship. I tried hanging with acquaintances but I soon learned why they were acquaintances. One day during winter break I went to their place and smoked- maybe too much, but I completely dissociated after from whatever was in the weed and never hung out with them again. Feeling off and in a dissociated state didn't help me in the social real. For the spring semester, I was in this dissociated state judging my actions out of my body. I know I was afraid I would lose my full-ride scholarship, but I seriously did not remember that spring semester or what I did. That spring semester I was placed on academic warning and my roommate got kicked out of ISU. I think that semester put me at a 2.66 GPA, before COVID I was at a 3.75. If I dropped below an overall 2.5 GPA I would lose my scholarship if my GPA the following semester was below 1.00 I would be kicked out of school. That semester I also got a new roommate which helped me socialize.

Coming back to ISU in person in 2021 I was in full fight-or-flight mode and I came to fight. I sought therapy and that helped me a lot lot, but I still went full feral mode to not lose my scholarship. I don't really remember that fall or spring semester. 

Coming back fall of 2022 was honestly when things got back to normal for me. I joined clubs, became president of a club and helped it regrow, went to bars, made deep connections, and lost some deep connections, but from what I've done I feel like I'm ready to graduate. I think graduating in five years over four has definitely helped me regain that sense of ownership of my college experience, but it has definitely come at the cost of my bank account‚Ä¶

I‚Äôve definitely learned a lot of valuable lessons about myself because of Covid. Lesson that I don't think I would have learned otherwise, but lessons I have only learned because I had to look deep into my soul. Lessons like that are scary. Loking back I should have dropped out of college for the sake of my mental health, but who knows if I'd be a semester away from being an Aero Engineer if I had.",0,5,,18vnz68,t3_18vnz68,/r/iastate/comments/18vnz68/covid_memories/kft8wdz/

6594,Post,"In light of recent posts, I wanted to share a classic gem from my experiences at Seasons last year. So there I am, sitting at the table facing the drink machines against the right wall as you walk in, and this student walks up to the cup rack. He grabs a cup from wide variety of options and proceeds to pour water into said cup. To this day, I have no idea what was going through this kid‚Äôs head, but the mf whole ass *tosses the cup in the air* trying to flip it and catch it, but instead, he fails to grab hold after it comes back down and water goes fucking everywhere. To say I was struggling to retain my laughter would be an understatement.

6596,Comment,"*My opinion only:* online will remain on the table until we get a vaccine and have stuck needles into every left arm on campus.  However, I really hope the ISU community can firewall the spread of this thing enough that we don't have to pull that lever again.

*Long-winded analysis follows:*

We're closely monitoring the public health reports.  One interesting thing about the current Story County spike is that we're seeing rapid growth in infections, but we're not seeing a commensurate growth in hospitalizations.  Locally, almost all of the current wave of cases are in the 18-40 age bracket.  So this supports the data from places that got hit hard earlier in the pandemic: younger patients tend to experience less-severe symptoms.

To build on that, IDPH is saying that about half of those cases are being identified through contact tracing, rather than primary testing.  So... let's say /u/redburr (to randomly pick a user here) calls Thielen with COVID-like symptoms.  Thielen has Red come in, takes nasal samples in the parking lot, and sends those to the lab.  The lab results come back COVID-positive.  IDPH follows up with Red for contact tracing, which basically comes down to, ""tell us everyone with whom you've spent 15 minutes or longer, within 6 feet, since 48 hours before you became symptomatic.""

Red reconstructs the last weekend of ~~heavy partying~~ heavy studying and says, ""why, yes, I spent several hours ~~drinking and playing Cards Against Humanity~~ reviewing chemistry and sociology material with /u/PolycultureBoy"" (to randomly select another recent correspondent).  IDPH then calls Polyculture and says, ""yo, Red just got the Rona, hie thyself to a testing site posthaste.""  Polyculture feels fine but is a responsible adult, so goes and gets tested.  Surprise!  Polyculture's results come back COVID-positive too.

With about half the cases being identified this way, rather than by someone seeking out testing because they feel like death on a stick, that also tells us that a *lot* of people are asymptomatic.  This supports wearing face coverings, because the point of those (one more time for the sleepers in the back row) is to keep *you* from infecting *others*, not to protect you from them.

Additionally, it says that student-age infections are less likely to crash Mary Greeley with ICU cases because most of those patients will be fine with outpatient care and home convalescence.  ""Less likely"" doesn't mean impossible, though...

Finally and most critically, it underlines the importance of being helpful and honest in the contact tracing process if you test positive.  In our example above, Polyculture is likely to be fine with mild/no symptoms.  But if Polyculture is on campus and infects other students, someone who's immunocompromised might have an unpleasant outcome.  Likewise, if it gets to, say, me or /u/puleshan, you may have one less ISU employee on this sub shortly thereafter, because the effects tend to be much more severe for patients of our age, and even worse for our most senior colleagues.

So: Practice physical distancing.  Wash your hands.  Wear your face covering.  Stay home if you're sick.  Save Steve Butler.

6658,Post,"Kind of a rant, but I feel like the dining subscription plans here have taken a nosedive in value, especially this last year. 

The $9 flex meals just seem to be not worth it in any way. If you get a meal worth $8.50 with a flex meal, you'd think the extra $0.50 would transfer to your dining dollars account, right? Nope, 'the money goes away'. That is what the ISU dining site states verbatim. 

https://www.dining.iastate.edu/meal-plans/flex-meals-dining-dollars-explained/

Well, at least now you can get more food variety and get two main courses if you want now, right? Wrong, most of the prices in the cafes don't allow for two mains, because they're typically priced above $4.50, with maybe a couple exceptions (You aren‚Äôt getting two godfathers mini pizzas). Drinks are also calculated into the cost which means getting a main and two larger sides with a drink is now nigh impossible. 

The WORST part is pricing information is not listed on their website for any of the cafes. Why???? Now I need to do mental math every time I want to get a meal bundle. Didn‚Äôt know I should‚Äôve brought a calculator with me to the caf√©.  

What was wrong with the simple two sides and a main with drink equals one swipe? Heck, three years ago you were able to get three sides with a main and a drink and it was glorious. 

Why not just purchase my meal plan‚Äôs total cost in dining dollars and only use dining dollars for all food purchases? Bulk purchasing dining dollars gives a discount, you can use them at panda express + caribou etc., and the money doesn‚Äôt ‚Äògo away‚Äô. 

Just seems like a really flawed system to me. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm missing some key vital info here that might support why they went this way. 

What do you guys think?

6659,Post,"Hi everyone,

I'm assisting a friend in their search for a 1-bedroom, 1-bathroom apartment, and we're looking for recommendations that meet the following criteria:

\- Must have a washing machine and, ideally, a dishwasher.

\- Free heating in the winter is essential. The total rent, including all utilities (internet, water, etc.), should not exceed $900.

\- Proximity to public transit is a priority, ideally near lines 1, 2, or 3.

\- An included parking spot is a significant plus, and, if possible, a private garage would be great.

\- Good natural light is important (we prefer large windows).

Additionally, does anyone have tips on the best time to sign a lease to avoid high costs or unfavorable terms? Any advice on timing or general renting strategies would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you in advance for any leads or tips!",1,0,0.43,1ghfm0c,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/1ghfm0c/looking_for_1b1b_apartment_recommendations/

6675,Comment,"1. I said 7 or 10

2. I'm right about dining dollars. They're more versatile and not every time you eat will need to be a full meal. College kids will eat plenty of meals that are just a piece of fruit, some chips, some pop, whatever while the study or hang out. 

3. That's the point. Why pay up front for an all you can eat buffet 2 or 3 times a day every day of the week when there are many many decisions you can make that will prevent you from wanting to eat at an all you can eat buffet. Whether it's getting tired of the food, being off campus, going home for the weekend, going out drinking, just wanting a banana for breakfast, friends want to go out to eat, you are being offered free food at a club, your dorm floor is having free food at their weekly meeting, you're studying in the library and don't want to move, you'd rather order delivery food, ect.

The list goes on and on. And ISU doesn't cut you a check for meals you don't use. And you could drink 16 beers for $8. Or 8 coffees. Or 5 bags of chips. All you can eat buffets are expensive. ",1,2,,4csd5v,t1_d1ldx9d,/r/iastate/comments/4csd5v/how_are_foods_from_isu_dining_hall/d1le6xx/

So I have a project for another class that requires me to go into the Human Nutritional Sciences Building, and visit the courtyard. The problem is, for the life of me, I can't find the courtyard lmao. 

I asked 3 students if they knew how to get to it while I was walking around trying to find it, and none of them had a clue lol. I am now looking at the floor plan, and it looks like there is only one entrance, but you have to go through a conference room to get to it? And there is currently only what I can assume to be a conference or a class going on in there right now. This building's design is so bad it's making me want to switch to fucking Architecture and fix it. Anyways, if there's anyone who isn't a dumbass like me and could point me to another entrance I would be forever grateful!

6705,Comment,"I worked in seasons last semester and it was not fun. 

Apparently, not many people apply so early in the year (I started August 11th) so there were sooo many scheduling vacancies. This meant that I had a LOT of work to do and basically had to run the stations myself with the black shirt doing their best to help but also busy preparing food in the kitchen. This also meant that I didn‚Äôt really meet anybody. 

My first shift was not great either. I was put on table cleaning duty for a four hour shift from 4:30-8:30pm. However, I ended up staying until 10:30pm because of cleanup after closing, and I didn‚Äôt wanna feel bad for making the student manager have to do everything. He finally let us all go at 10:30 even though we still weren‚Äôt done. I also walked **7 MILES** in my constant trips around the dining center. 

Upper management is pretty toxic too. There‚Äôs so many rules about time and schedules. You do get 15 minutes to eat a free meal during a four hour shift or longer, so a lot of time slots are 3 hours and 45 minutes! Seriously?!? Most of my conversations with the black shirts (who are mostly pretty chill btw) involved how shit the management was and how overworked they are too as full time employees. I really felt bad for them since they likely don‚Äôt have the financial or job flexibility that I had.

Finally, the mental part was tough on me too. I‚Äôm studying engineering, had 18 credits this semester, and was already lacking on sleep before having to be up at 6 to make my 6:30 shift three days a week. I never fell asleep on the job, but I felt like my brain had fallen asleep and my body was just aimlessly moving sometimes. When I tried to get less breakfast shifts, they said it would take 2-3 weeks to get the changes. 

I figured I had made enough money to get me through the rest of the semester so I decided to quit. When I called for that, they said that I am still responsible for my shifts over the next two weeks, and the penalty for not showing up would be that I can‚Äôt work for them again while I‚Äôm a student. However, the penalty for not finishing the semester in the first place is also that I‚Äôm not allowed to go back and work for them. So I just abandoned my shifts after about 7 weeks with no intention of wanting to work their anyway. 

Overall, if you can take it with your class schedule and the money is worth it to you, then I‚Äôm sure you can push through. It just wasn‚Äôt for me at a certain point. I know plenty of people who like working there and one relationship that came from the two meeting on a shift, so it‚Äôs not impossible. 

You only really commit to a semester, so I‚Äôd say try and figure it out for yourself. You can always quit if you really don‚Äôt like it.",0,31,,kn3pe9,t3_kn3pe9,/r/iastate/comments/kn3pe9/thinking_of_getting_an_on_campus_job/ghilnnb/

-----

**Federal COVID-19 Time Off and Leave Program Expiring**

The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) will expire on December 31, 2020. The FFCRA was enacted earlier this year to provide eligible employees with additional time off and leave options for reasons related to COVID-19. In response to the expiring federal program, Iowa State University is making available new COVID-19 sick time off options for employees, beginning January 1, 2021. Please note these options may be subject to change should new information be provided by federal or state government or the Board of Regents. ISU will continue to monitor closely and communicate accordingly.  


**New ISU COVID-19 Sick Time Off Options Effective January 1, 2021**


**‚Ä¢ Hourly Student Employees/Temporary Employees/Seasonal Employees:** Up to 20 hours of paid time off.

* This is a new time off bank that will be loaded on an individual basis should the employee be unable to work their scheduled hours due to illness, isolation, and/or quarantine related to COVID-19.

* A separate communication will be sent to active student employees to make them aware that they may be eligible for paid sick time off related to COVID-19.

**Effective Dates**

These COVID-19 sick time off options are effective on January 1, 2021, and are able to be used through June 30, 2021, or when a new federal program is enacted, or when the state of Iowa is no longer under a state of emergency.",7,58,0.99,kflnpf,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/kflnpf/student_workers_youre_eligible_for_covid_leave_in/

6801,Comment,">I said 7 or 10

And I'm saying, instead of getting 7 or 10 meals per week, get 14, and spend less on dining dollars. Or just get 11. My main point is don't buy extra dining dollars.

>College kids will eat plenty of meals that are just a piece of fruit, some chips, some pop, whatever

I don't see many people eating snacks while studying in the library. if anything they drink coffee, which would be more than covered by the dining dollars that come in a typical plan (and also you could even own a coffee maker in your dorm). I think most people really do just eat regular meals as their main source of food, particularly freshman who are coming from their parent's household and high school lunch routine.

>getting tired of the food, being off campus, going home for the weekend, going out drinking, just wanting a banana for breakfast, friends want to go out to eat, you are being offered free food at a club, your dorm floor is having free food at their weekly meeting

You're drastically overestimating the amount of free food that is offered. Dorm meetings don't have free pizza very often. Clubs have them when employers come, but how many clubs can you realistically go to?

Again, the calories from two slices of pizza is around 500-600, clearly not enough to even replace a meal.

Your dorm likely won‚Äôt provide food on days it is super cold/snowy and you‚Äôll have to go out. I would expect maybe a couple events a month in your dorm where you could get free food if you show up. My friends and I have gotten whole boxes of pizza showing up to events where very little people came. 

I think most people on the gold plan get by just fine. If you‚Äôre super worried about not having enough food, you could get the cardinal plan. It‚Äôs $150 more a semester but you will have unlimited meal swipes. You can go into a dining hall at any time they are open and grab a small snack and leave.

I dunno, maybe you are short and don't need to eat much. Certainly if you lift weights and are active, it's normal to eat roughly 2.6k cal a day. And I don't see any cheaper way to do this than eat two large meals at the UDCC.

6834,Comment,"I am a student supervisor that works for ISU Dining and I have talked with plenty of other students in my position and managerial positions about this topic. You are correct to think that ISU Dining has become more of a scam than anything. 

ISU Dining used to be a service when I was a freshman. It was easy, had a wide variety of plans, and dining centers were on a monthly schedule of food options. 

A few years ago, administration and management changed in the higher up forms and this is when ISU Dining became a business to cut costs and stopped being a service to students. 

Like you said in your post, bundles disappeared, third party food options were abandoned for ISU themed venues, and plans became convoluted. 

Students that live in the dorm are required to get a meal plan and that makes ISU Dining the monopoly for food options for a large portion of the student body. 

If you think this is a problem, you need to speak out because this is extorting* students for every penny and providing the bear minimum. Future students should not have to experience this and ISU Dining needs to remember that they should be a service for the student, not a business to get every penny.

6864,Comment,"This has been a problem for a couple years. I've stop eating at the west side dining areas completely. When I  lived on campus in 2018-19 the food at udcc was really good in the fall. Burgers, grilled cheese or chicken tenders at least 4-5 days a week. Suddenly the pizza became greasy dough with tomato water and whatever that gooey stuff on top it is. The foods I listed would maybe show up 2 times a week. And when they served it it would be gone by 1pm. I almost never eat before 2pm so I would pay for my meal walk in and see that the only things left were a halal hot dog and vegan tenders. As a picky eater It's not worth a swipe to go in to these dining centers only to find the only thing left that's appetizing is the cereal bar. This year I've been exclusively going to convos and the mu because of they don't have what I want I can leave before I waste money on something I don't want. If they stop the take out options after the pandemic then I probably won't get a meal plan again. It just feels like the quality goes down each semester but the price goes up.

6876,Comment,">Are you seriously doubting a college kids ability to get 2.6k calories with one all you can eat buffet every single day? 

In a healthy way, yes. The majority of healthy foods are not very calorie dense, so it's difficult, but not impossible to get enough calories in one meal when you're solely eating healthy. Think three large plates of food in one sitting. Is this something you've actually done yourself? I've eaten one meal per day before, and I either had to spend an annoying long time eating the meal, or I had to eat snacks during the day to lessen the meal beforehand.

>And I still can't grasp how you think that an all you can eat buffet twice a day is going to be 100% super healthy whereas any other meal someone eats at any other location is going to be super unhealthy. 

Stop putting words in my mouth. The other places you've been mentioning are fast food places, so that's what I was responding to. I think you need to read up on nutrition. The UDCC has lots of unhealthy options, but if you avoid those, it actually has lots of healthy options that would actually be somewhat expensive to buy yourself, including organic apples, blueberries, steak, etc.

6879,Comment,"Have better ways to hold professors accountable. Some professors are going above and beyond to make class accessible and helpful, but others are taking it as a chance to do less work and have students learn almost completely from the textbook. There are also quite a few professors who have twice as many hours of lecture videos per week than would be allowed for an in-person class. While these professors are certainly not the majority, it can be very hard to hold them accountable. We have to report them to our advisor and most times that means that change will only come the semester after, which doesn't help the current students. Being online seems to have made a lot of these professors come out of the woodwork and it seems like there is no way to improve these classes so that students are actually able to learn.",0,29,,j2py5k,t3_j2py5k,/r/iastate/comments/j2py5k/how_could_we_make_spring_semester_less_awful/g77h5nf/

6- Don't get on the rear doors. They are powered by air and that system can be 90-135psi. Plenty to cause serious pain and injury. Plus you're budging the line like a dick. I will stop the bus and come have a chat with you.

Now that the safety concerns are dealt with, some odds and ends

7- Waiting at a stop at night? Turn on a cellphone or stand under a light so I can see you.

8- If you don't know ask. There's nothing worse than carrying someone across town at midnight only to find out they thought the bus went to Freddy but weren't sure

9- Don't walk to ""catch"" the front doors. I can stop with them infront of you if you're the only person at the stop, but only if you don't keep walking away

10- Pull the stop request cord asap after LEAVING the current stop. If you pull it while at the stop I think you want off there, open the doors and the stop request for the next stop gets cancelled.

11- The PAPER SCHEDULE is the holy Cyride Bible. The app may say I'll be at student services at 10:16 but that's a prediction, the paper schedule will tell you my timepoint is 10:15 and I'll be long gone by 10:16.

6961,Post,"I was skeptical at first yet it exceeded my expectations. Shoutout all the homies at Seasons who worked their asses off. 

Presentation: I was pleasantly surprised when I saw my spread of wonderful Thanksgiving classics. Turkey - decent portion size, lean and carved right in front of you at Wood Grill. Carrots - seasoned well but lacking some major roasting. Yukon mashed potatoes - basic. Gravy - wasn‚Äôt very promising. Cranberry Relish - cute little portion size, typical. Pumpkin pie - perfect amount of whipped cream, looked great! Cornbread ‚Äùdressing‚Äú - It‚Äòs called stuffing but ok...looked unreasonably moist. Powermilk - ok I‚Äòm just messing around. 

Flavor & Texture: This is obviously the most important category. I was both satisfied and disappointed. Let‚Äôs start with some sides. Cranberry Relish - good flavor but you know it comes from a can. Carrots - disappointing, very soft and sweet yet cold and flavorless. Cornbread dressing - So good. I actually really enjoyed the classic stuffing flavor and texture was just right! Now for the bulk of the meal...Yukon mashed potatoes - quite natural taste, barely any seasoning but that‚Äôs what gravy is for. Gravy - tasteful, warm, scrumptious. Turkey - lean and tasty, quite dry but then again gravy. Pumpkin pie - delicious, and accompanied my meal perfectly. 

I can honestly say I was fulfilled with this meal. It really shocked me how well Seasons and presumably the other dining halls did with this. As I walked past the overflowing dish line, praying for my poor coworkers, I reflected on my meal and smiled a little with a sense of nostalgia and happiness that I got to have a somewhat normal Thanksgiving.

Presentation: 8/10
Flavor: 7.5/10
Texture: 6/10

6965,Post,"It's just a series of bad decisions one right after another for this CIO.  It is very clear he is an accountant and not someone that understands how an IT department works.
Let‚Äôs take a look at these great decisions-

* Step one, have no transparent plan.  Keep everyone guessing.
* If anyone leaves ITS, don‚Äôt rehire their position.  Load all work they were doing on other people.
* Anyone hired into ITS should be a spousal accommodation.  This saves money.
* Positions should be term, viewed as temporary from the outside.  This way we can‚Äôt get any knowledgeable people in place.
* Move all departmental servers to a central ‚Äúdatacenter.‚Äù Oh but there isn‚Äôt enough room and the datacenter has no security and power problems.
* Everything should be in the cloud!  Select AWS as the provider without any sort of bid process or vetting outside of devs.
* Find out AWS would cost too much money for all ISU does.  It also doesn‚Äôt integrate well with existing systems.  Never talk about it again.
* Berate and yell at employees in front of their peers.  This is a great morale booster.
* Try to move up an employee‚Äôs retirement date.  HR said no, but they don‚Äôt understand the rules don‚Äôt apply to the CIO.
* Funnel all calls into the solution center, but give them little to no training on how to handle these calls.  Blackboard support moved from CELT to the Solution Center.  They couldn‚Äôt handle the issues because no one had been trained.
* Lay people off, but call it reorganization.  Try to get the 90 days P&S employees‚Äô pay changed to 60 days.  University policies are just guidelines anyway.
* Lay off all but two full time people in the solution center.  Manager put in her two-weeks shortly after.  Now staffed almost exclusively by students. 
* Lay off all the classroom people and start using consulting services that cost way more than if done in house.
* Lay off high level directors leaving only gym buddies and yes-men in place.
* Manipulate the media, making them think the union workers were in a room with computers.  Talk about online training courses they could take while in the room.  Really mean Lynda.com.
* Seriously consider not renewing maintenance on a portion of the mainframe.  Maybe employees wouldn‚Äôt mind not getting paid.
* Post bid request for an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system, but write it so the market leaders are disqualified.
 
If anyone wants to pick up any IT employees, a lot of them specialized, now is a good time.  Morale is so low, many IT professionals are looking to leave before they too get ‚Äúreorganized.‚Äù  The only people with a good opinion of this CIO are either in the inner circle, developers, or have no clue what is going on.  There was no nationwide search for the position, as the provost promised.  A week after stating that, he installed this interim CIO.  The president decided to make the CIO permanent and switch him from reporting to the provost directly to Leath.  He was also upgraded to a Senior Vice President.       	
 
Many people feel the reorganization was a cover to remove people the CIO had differing opinions with, but also threw in a few justified layoffs to make it look legit.

6980,Comment,"We felt that the first problem had some variants which from an instructors perspective were equivalent (and when you see the solutions they will not seem that different in difficulty) but for whatever reason students did not have it click and so we made an adjustment.  The other problems had variations and some students did slightly better on some parts and slightly worse on other parts, but not to the point where we felt it required intervention.

Of course it is hard to measure knowledge in math.  And honestly there does not exist an exam or any other machine or method that can measure how good you are at math.  What we can do is measure how well you communicate what you know.  Which is why it is important to learn how to express yourself and your knowledge (most majors require English for a reason).  So it is not uncommon to have a student who is great at math do poorly because they keep making small mistakes and trip over themselves in their answers; while a student is OK at math can do fine by taking the time to carefully and correctly set up the problem (where a significant number of points lie) even when they can't finish it.

The solutions will be posted later today.  I encourage everyone to look at the solutions and also to carefully go over their own tests and ask:  ""What can I do differently next time so I know what I am doing and I can convince the graders I know what I am doing?""",0,2,,71yh62,t1_dnhrcls,/r/iastate/comments/71yh62/i_am_a_steve_butler_ask_me_anything/dnhulxw/

6985,Post,"I had a date yesterday, and I tried a new restaurant: Applebe‚Äôs on Chestnut Street. This is my first time at this particular Applebee‚Äôs  and I wanted to give a brief review.

The first place they went wrong was the tablets that you are supposed to be able to order from at the table. Ours was broken. Maybe the battery was just dead. Regardless of the cause, it was very disappointing, and I had to place my order through an incompetent waiter. He was a little bit awkward to be honest. Fortunately he did not try to make small talk, but all of our interactions with him were a little uncomfortable. But once our drinks came everything got better. I had the raspberry lemonade and it was TO DIE FOR. My date had a coca-cola and she did not remark on its quality.

Then things went downhill again. I overheard our waiter say that he didn‚Äôt care about our table because he had another table of 7 people. There was a 10 minute gap between finishing my second lemonade and receiving a third (would have been nice if the tablet was working).

The food was exceptional. I had the chicken tenders with ranch dressing. The chicken was perfectly crispy and had a great flavor profile that was complemented by the creamy, tangy ranch dressing. My date had chicken parmesan and again did not remark on its quality.

As we finished our meal and prepared to leave, the waiter asked us if anything was wrong and my date spoke up and said she was not happy with the service. He gave a half-hearted apology and said he would try to do better next time. Unfortunately it is unlikely that there will be a next time. He then tried to make small talk (which he had done a good job of avoiding earlier) and delayed our departure. Although the food was high quality, the dining experience was tainted by the malfunctioning tablet and poor waiting service. I paid for both of my meals and did not leave a tip.

A full week of 5 hrs of lectures was topped off with a 3 hour exam for me in 1 class last week.  Most couldn‚Äòt even finish the exam in the 3 hours.  Add exam review and then study time and that was 15-20 hrs for most students.  12 credits of that and most of us are putting in 60-80 hours.",0,3,,j2py5k,t1_g77dsnm,/r/iastate/comments/j2py5k/how_could_we_make_spring_semester_less_awful/g7gpjg0/

6994,Post,"As non-freshman know, this year, Iowa State moved their dining and residential management system from Access-Plus to StarRez. For me, it was just the latest in a series of concerning management decisions the University has made. Why? Because Iowa State already had a housing and dining management system in Access Plus. There was no need to move to a third party system, a system which is lacking many of the features that Access Plus had. 

I would also like to point out this is not the only example of this. Iowa State has also been extensively using a Des Moines digital marketing agency called Flying Hippo. [Here is a link to some of what they've done...](https://www.flyinghippo.com/work/iowa-state/#2). They've been slowly giving this marketing agency more and more work, from the interior in dining locations to websites. These contracts are huge.

My question is: why? The university has amazing Design, Engineering, and Marketing colleges, which have had student employees and career-staff manage this stuff for years. So why our we outsourcing these jobs in lucrative contracts? 

Anyone else have good examples of this trend? Seems wrong.",17,43,0.94,jnes6s,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/jnes6s/anyone_else_concerned_about_how_iowa_state_is_in/

I know the closest residence halls are Helser Eaten Friley etc, but I am more looking for a dorm that everyone doesn't have a stick up there ass and still parties. Seems weird for a math major to be a party person but yeah it happens. Are any of those dorms near Carver party dorms, and if not is MWL area to far away on bike ride to get to Carver with in reason? Also for anyone who took a bike up there before is it impossible to ride them around in the winter? Which of the two neighborhoods is close to one of the better dining centers? Also the fuck is Wilson doing so far out? Just as a reference my entire knowledge of the campus comes from the online map.

But seriously, people usually don't take birds into consideration when making buildings because it's just kind of assumed that some of them will always hit any structure. As an example, one issue with windmills is that they produce pockets of air that gather bugs, which attracts raptors who die on the turbine blades.

As for a way to solve this, there really isn't a great way to do it beyond re-doing all the windows. Maybe some kind of high-pitched sound deterrent might work, but even that would be costly and may not actually make a difference.

Also, in comparison to other things that kill birds, this might not be a consequential issue. Domestic house cats kill millions upon millions of birds every year in the USA alone. I know it's not the best argument to say ""Well what about this other bad thing?"", but if saving bird lives is an issue, then the most cost/resource efficient way to handle it might be to impose new rules on keeping cats outdoors.",0,5,,g78n5h,t3_g78n5h,/r/iastate/comments/g78n5h/student_innovation_center_vs_birds/fofytcx/

7168,Post,"I purchased the silver dining plan assuming that the dining hall situation would not have been set up as poorly as it was this semester. I, along with about 10-15 of my friends that I know, have over 90 swipes/flex meals left over. I dont know when they expire, but I know that you can use as many flex meals in one order as you want. We are considering recruiting a large amount of homeless people and ordering 90+ meals with our flex meal and giving them out. 

It is the dumbest thing that the swipes expire each semester. Now I was well aware of this the previous years, but we purchased my plan pre-covid and didnt expect the very poor management of the dining halls to turn out how they did, so none of us went to them and ended up just going to hawthorn or somewhere to use a flex meal. We didnt find enough outlets of time to keep eating lance and ellies, hot food, etc to get rid of all of our swipes. I believe this would be a great revolt to the poor choice made by ISU Dining due to covid, and this would be within policy and could be for a very good cause.

This post is merely to gather thoughts of others that may work for ISU Dining, or have a similar experience with all these leftovers swipes which can equal up to thousands of dollars.  

tldr: covid made most students with dining plans left over with way too many swipes to lose at the end of the semester. we should use them for a bunch of meals and give them all to those in need to revolt against this poorly planned expiration of meal swipes during a global pandemic",5,99,0.95,k2zpil,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/k2zpil/using_the_stupid_isu_dining_swipes_policy_for_good/

Source: I am a transportation planner and currently focused on transit (bus, regional bus, rail, light rail, etc)

The goal would be to both maximize connectivity between highly traveled areas as well as not impeding traffic too much as to cause other issues in the city. This design does a decent job but I would change a few things. 

For one, I would take out the stop at Jack trice and go further south toward Ames Fitness. Or, alternatively go more west where there are a lot of residential areas. When folks go to the stadium for games usually they park in grass lots near by and it's a short walk over. Im not sure how many folk would actually use that part of the route (the MPO's travel demand model could tell us this but I don't have access to that).

Two, I wouldn't have the light rail go along Lincoln Way. That road is already full of traffic and it's a 4 lane without any spacing between opposing directions (and land locked unless you want to declare eminent domain on the properties to expand it to both keep travel lanes and add in a new LRT line). 

Not a bad effort that's for sure! A few tweaks and maybe some additional lines would be cool.",0,10,,16kim4s,t3_16kim4s,/r/iastate/comments/16kim4s/lrt_system_for_isu_and_ames/k0z9pjo/

I tried that for the first week. 9/10 people would just ignore it so I had no choice by to run over the grass or slip in between them and a concrete wall.

Why am I on the sidewalk? There's no crosswalk that crosses Stange Road near me so I can't safely cross the street. The street has a speed limit of 35 so I can't safely ride on it. That leaves me with one choice until I get to campus: the thin sidewalk with people on it.

I last lived on campus in 2020 so this may be changing but Conversations (convos) is in the basement of oak/elm and is get and go only. Their menu is mostly chicken tenders, fries, burgers etc. 

The big dining center on east side is Seasons in the middle of Maple Willow Larch. Menu is on a 2-3week rotation. Dining center food is amazing first semester for freshman then you get sick of it. Seasons has a ton of options. I miss the weekend brunch menu. 

If it‚Äôs cold you have to tough it out and go somewhere. I always stashed snacks and microwave meals in my room. Dorms dont cater to students buildings in the cold. Your meal plan depends on how much you plan on eating. I always had classes through lunch so I had a ton of swipes leftover.

7238,Comment,"Alright this may get a tad long if so I apologize, but I tutored foe 2 and a half years. 

First the interview process is super easy. You get together with a group of people and just talk and do a couple of activities just so they can get your general vibe. I knew I got the job while walking home after. 

However, tutoring services has drastically gone downhill and made so many changes that make being a tutor way harder and stressful than it needs to be. In fact I was told by mentors that they lost a record number of tutors last semester bc of the bs they are doing. 

Unless they changed it back (which they should) it is an hour and a half once a week per session. With my ADHD it was a nightmare to try to stay focused on talking with people the entire time and they became less engaged and didn't care. 

You also get paid an hour of prep time a week which I heard made the job way more stressful, but in general I didn't mind it because I already had all my stuff from previous years. 

The pay is pretty bad, but it's there I guess. Always make sure to show up for a session because due to back end stuff trying to reschedule something is a pain anymore. 

However, if you are working in a dining center it may be worth making the switch it is just upto you and before some changes it was actually a really fun job so I hope they fix them.

7305,Post,"A mental health discussion over in another thread reminded me that I'd been meaning to post something.  

Earlier this week, I was out on campus with a colleague who started working here in July 2020.  She looked around during a class change and said, ""this is the first time I've actually seen campus look like it's supposed to.""  That was a stark reminder for me that two years ago this week was the first week of fully online classes (and the first confirmed COVID-19 cases in Story County).

This semester, we're back to what we're euphemistically calling ""normal operations.""  I'm not sure we're back to pre-pandemic norms, though.  I see a lot of closed and silent offices when I walk through the academic buildings.  The student population on campus seems more furtive, less inclined to be on campus for the sake of being on campus.  I'm afraid we've conditioned people to stay away, and for some, that's become the norm rather than a temporary (if extended) protective measure.  And I worry about the long-term effects of that, and I worry about the absence of the things and activities and people I'm not seeing.

So... how's everyone coping this semester?  Are you getting the support you need?  Are you really okay or does that response now mean ""barely clinging to sanity, but let's say 'okay' for the sake of this conversation?""",12,29,0.89,tntdw8,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/tntdw8/hey_isu_hows_everyone_doing_this_week/

At the end there is a condiment station, which causes a big line even if there is not that many people (most of the wait time there is caused by this single station I think). From right to left there is seasoning, ketchup/mustard/bbq, then burger toppings. 

Each section can really only have one person serving themself at once, and you need to go through them right to left because you can't go back in line really. So if you want mustard and tomato on your burger, and the person in front of you is only getting sauce for their chicken tenders, you need to wait for them to be done with the sauce before you can even start. The sauces are used by literally everyone, so there should be a better way to do this.",0,9,,1c1vulp,t3_1c1vulp,/r/iastate/comments/1c1vulp/question_about_isu_dining/kz71oki/

I was surprised to see the low numbers, particularly for PhD level faculty conducting research, teaching, and bringing in grant funding. I was even more surprised to see that there are multimillion dollar salaries in the athletics department.

I understand that athletics bring in quite a bit of money to the school, but is there anywhere to see a breakdown of how these coaching salaries are justified, especially in light of all the concerns about salary and benefits for other employees that you raised in this post? Given your experience and involvement with these issues, what are your thoughts on this? Are athletic salaries a completely separate pool?

We generally stick with the menu as listed for legal and liability reasons. If we start with a different product, we actually have to have management contact our menu guy to change what's listed to reflect what's actually being served. 

This does not, however, always occur, and also doesn't have to happen necessarily when a product runs out and we run a replacement item. Regardless, signage on the product itself should be correct.

As for the rest, you're likely not wrong and that's definitely above my pay grade.",1,8,,11a1ygx,t1_j9q625s,/r/iastate/comments/11a1ygx/5300_calorie_meatloaf/j9qaex1/

7350,Post,"I spent a lot of time my freshman year finding things in and around campus to explore! If you're a freshman or just an ISU student that's looking for new things to do, look no further! Here's my own list of everything I could think of to do. ^((This list includes no bars or 21+ activites))

# On Campus

* **The Memorial Union**

Home to many organizations I will list later, but the Memorial Union (or The MU for short) has events going on frequently, most set up by the Student Union Board. **Cyclone Cinema** plays *recentish* movies most days of the week, **Comedy Nights** where they bring in seasoned comediens, **ISU Afterdark** where they typically bring in a comedian and an actor to talk, along with other events and crafts all over the MU (which to be honest can be a hit or miss for me sometimes, check it out to see if you like anything they have going on!), **Cybowl & Billiards,** and other one-off events. Even if you aren't interested in the events, many of them are good opportunites to get free stuff.

*  **The Workspace**

Located in the Memorial Union, this is for the creatives! There is **Paint your own Pottery** almost every day with a rotating selection of things to paint. Good for custom gifts for family or friends. They occasionally have other crafts you can pay to make as well.

* **Maintenance Shop (M-Shop)**

Located in the Memorial Union, the M-shop is open during the day and is a good study spot, but it also hosts many events like **Grandma Mojo's Improv Comedy, Open Mic Night**, and most importantly-- **Live Music**! I can personally reccomend going to all of these, and I reccomend going to Open Mic Nights especially at the begining of each semester to get a good balance of comedy and musical acts. The tickets for live music and improv comedy are very inexpensive (*improv being only $1*) so keep an eye out for local bands performing!

* **Clubs and StuOrgs**

Many Clubs and StuOrgs will have events open to people who aren't members! If you're interested in art, the design college art club hosts events for things like **printmaking or pottery** for those with no experience. There's pretty much a club for everything you can think of, so look at the list online and check out those that interest you.

* **State Gym**

I'm not a big gym or sport person, so I have not much to say here. There's events for those who want to play sports in a group. There's also a **pool, hot tub, and a rock climbing area**, which I found fun!

* **The Center & The Multicultural Student Association**

Both Located in the Memorial Union and make for great study spots, and are also great for finding resources for LGBT and Multicultural students. Follow their social medias, as they both put on events frequently! Just off the top of my head they've done **Block Parties, Plushie making, Drag shows, Socials, Therapy Dogs** and **Self-Care packages.** (and a BTW if you're interested in dogs, Hamilton Hall has ""Press Paws"" which brings a therapy dog in almost every day!)

In the same vein, I reccomend checking out **The Sloss House** for resources and events for Women, LGBT Students, and Multicultural students. The environment is very welcoming and is a good study spot (or nap spot, if I'm being entirely honest)

* **Stephens Auditorium**

Has an event almost every month. Not technically through ISU, but they have larger events here like **Musicals, Music Performances** (Apparently Shrek the Musical is coming this year)**,** and occastionally some traveling tours will make their way here too. 

* **The Joan Bice Underwood Tea Room**

Serves lunch and fine dining at a more affordable price, because it's staffed by culinary students! Haven't been yet, but also want to go. 

* **ISU Dining**

The dining halls across campus will do themed nights, less of a thing to 'go do' but they will typically serve food they normally don't along with little prizes you can win so I always like to go. 

* **Student Innovation Center** 

The Student Innovation Center has workshops you can sign up for if you're interested in learning a new skill, like woodworking or even some things for content creators.

* **Residence Hall Events** 

If you're living on-campus, your res hall will undoubtely be hosting events for your building or your neighborhood. Go check them out, even if it's just for the free snacks.



Many other places on campus will also have events, check your e-mail and sign up for the **Iowa State Daily** for more events! Also, for freshman, reccomend going to many of the new student events. Even if you don't really care to socalize, I got more than enough plastic cups and tote bags to use for the entire year through the booths and such. Keep a lookout for posters on builitan boards for events from stuorgs and fellow students.

# Off Campus 

* **Reliable Street**

The home of Lockwood Cafe, a community garden, and also an Ames organization that puts on events like **Open Mic Nights**, **Punch Up Comedy, Poetry Slams,** **Local Markets, Live Music,** and **Art Instalations**. The environment is very accepting and is a nice place to get breakfast. 

* **Farmers Market**

Goes from May to October. Check out local produce.

* **Ice Skating**

When it starts to get cold, theres the Ames Ice Arena to go.

* **Trails and Outdoors**

While ISU campus has plenty to look at while walking around, off campus also has a lot of trails to check out!

* **Downtown Ames**

The shopping district. Downtown Ames has an online calander for community events as well. 

* **Reiman Gardens**

As an ISU student, you get access into Reiman for free! There's things to do all year long, from flowers to their butterfly garden to their Christmas light show. 

* **Geocaching**

An on and off-campus activity. If you're into escape rooms or enjoy mental puzzles then check out the geocaching website and try and solve all of them in town.

* **No Escape Iowa**

An escape room on Main street.

* **Time Out Arcade & Perfect Games**

It's an arcade! I haven't been before but it's something I want to check out this year. Perfect games also has **Bowling** and **Laser tag.**

* **Ames Ren Faire**

Happens towards the end of the school year. The Ames Ren Faire has only just started but this year there were lost of vendors and people in costume, if that's your thing.

* **Mayhem Comics**

A nerd store for those who like to play card games or dungeons and dragons. They have competition nights for **card games, board games**, and I believe also a **Dungeons and Dragons** night!

* **Dog Eared Books**

A welcoming bookstore. I hear they have **book clubs** for pretty much whatever you might be intersted in.

* **Clouds**

Admittedly, another thing that's less something to do and more of a place to study and eat. Clouds is something every student should go to at least once, as it provides a view of campus from like 8 stories above. It's very cool to see, and Clouds also has study competitions when it gets close to Finals Week.",5,29,0.94,1e7d2fq,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/1e7d2fq/list_of_things_to_do_in_amesisu/

7370,Comment,"This is correct on the speech part. We (company's you're applying to) know that you're talking to 10-20 companies (if not more) while you're there. That having been said, nobody is forcing you to hop from company to company. If there is a long line, pull your phone out and do research. If there isn't, take down the name, go and sit down somewhere and do some research.

OK questions:

* ""Can you give me more information on what type of customers you have?"" (This shows interest in the company, and often people don't list specific customers on their site. Doesn't work for customer-focused companies really)
* ""Can you give me examples of the type of work I would be doing if you were to offer me an internship?"" (This and the third question are essentially the same)
* ""What is a day life in a <Job Description> at your company?"" 

Not OK questions:

* ""What does your company do?""
* ""What type of internships does your company offer?""

Dressing up won't set you apart, we basically expect people to show up in business professional. We aren't going to judge a tailored suit vs one just purchased to fit, and we likely wouldn't judge a nice button-up/sweater and khaki's either. We \*will\* judge a tshirt and even jeans - though it can be overcome by really doing a great job on the interview. OP is absolutely right that isn't what you'd wear to your internship, but you're not at the internship yet; you're still trying to impress us. We will get over 300-400 resumes. You need to stand out.

7384,Post,"As you all know, Iowa State has been around for a very long time, since the late 1800s. We have a world-renowned veterinary program, and our science programs are just as reputable. Over the years, Iowa State has made leaps and bounds towards groundbreaking scientific discoveries and boasts a rich history that aided the growth of science to become what it is today. On the surface, you have been told of many accomplishments which aided such growth and high-standing; the first computer, the lead free solder, and the fax machine to name a few.

&#x200B;

But where are ISU‚Äôs mistakes? Where are the failed experiments? The science that pushed ethical boundaries? Do they really expect us to believe that since 1858, we have kept a PERFECT ethical practice in our research? Nonsense. We know better.

&#x200B;

After some digging, I‚Äôve uncovered some bone-chilling stuff centered around the veterinary program and the molecular biology projects. These records took weeks to find; isu has tried their damn hardest to cover it up.  I‚Äôve found records of extensive experimentation in the 1940s on geese. Hundreds of cages, each goose with a different set of chemical experimentation.

&#x200B;

I began to dig deeper. The staff at the MoleBi building refused to talk to me, and the library records officer threatened to report me to the board. I‚Äôve felt eyes on me ever since. That was perhaps the dumbest thing i‚Äôve ever done: assumed they weren‚Äôt in on it.

&#x200B;

After finding more documentation hidden within tier 0 of parks library, my suspicions were confirmed. A couple years after making progress with their geese experiments, they began experimenting with people as well. These horrifying trials went on for years until someone finally blew the whistle. By then, it was too late. Over 200 people were turned into geese. The scientists were arrested and prosecuted for animal abuse, and the university set the geese loose. Much easier to deal with an animal abuse scandal than a violated on the Nuremberg Code, which could shut down the university if word gets out.

&#x200B;

Since then, a group of 200 scholars turned geese have been left to their own devices, abandoned by their university. Today, their children gather at lake lavern to mark the 70 year anniversary, still desperately searching for a cure, so they may break the abusive chains wrapped around their bloodline.

&#x200B;

As for me, there‚Äôs nothing more to be done. I can only hope that someone reads this and aids the geese community in their search for freedom. Running and hiding is all that‚Äôs left for me. I need to keep moving. If i‚Äôm not careful, the task force consisting of ROTC members and nationally renowned cyber security experts will triangulate my position and bring me in. I‚Äôm burning this account right after this post: they have spies everywhere. Trust no one, and do whatever you can to help.

7447,Comment,"I haven't taught differential equations (yet) so most of what I am about to say is from 10+ years ago as a student/TA.

So differential equations as a topic can feel like a weird collection of various ideas that don't always feel connected.  That's because it is a weird collection of various ideas.  It turns out that in general solving differential equations is challenging and that there are only a very few special cases that have been able to be solved and those came after much trial and error.  We teach the ones that have solutions and teach the techniques that solved them and say ""of course this is how its done"", when the truth is that it took a long time to figure it out and isn't always obvious.  (To make matters worse most differential equations that are needed in practice aren't solvable using any of the methods we teach!)

Let's get back on track.  So unfortunately I don't know of any solid resources.  There are online videos but I haven't gone through them, SI (which can be good or bad), fellow class mates, etc.  One thing that might help is to think of the philosophy that underlies most of the techniques in solving differential equations:

* Make a good guess; modify to make a better guess/right answer.

By this I mean that most techniques involve making a guess at a solution, and then seeing how you have to modify your guess to make it work.  A classic example of this is the method of undetermined coefficients wherein you have a good idea of what the solution should look like (i.e., a generic form found through trial and error in the past) but you are not sure what precisely the right coefficients are, so you guess the form with some arbitrary constants in front and then run it through and see what the constants are that make it work.  This philosophy will come up again and again and once you spot a pattern then it becomes easier to understand what is happening.

This is a tough course, hang in there and keep studying, find fellow students to study with as well, shared misery helps.  Consistent practice is good (flash cards to look at while standing in line to help remind you of various things are useful).  And be extra careful with your arithmetic, this is one course with high demands for your abilities to keep track of what happens after several steps and then also to go and solve systems of equations with several variables and several unknowns.",0,1,,71yh62,t1_dnfgnup,/r/iastate/comments/71yh62/i_am_a_steve_butler_ask_me_anything/dnfofos/

7455,Comment,"Dining student from windows - 

I can say for sure that everyone is frustrated with it, including the cooks and students, but many apologies. I believe one part of it is the pandemic making supply and demand difficult (can confirm that seasons is also struggling, wish we could help).

But for us specifically, we lost important employees right before and as the pandemic began. One of our two managers is working down at Storms with some sort of team for management during the pandemic (temporarily), and our head cook retired this year. Its difficult to count numbers when understaffed, and the cooks we have are trying their best with the time they have (cant go over a certain amount of hours, university policy i believe).

I cant say anything for any other dining centers, but at windows we are trying our best with what help we've got. But like still,, thanks for being patient, much appreciated,,",0,3,,iwpgg6,t3_iwpgg6,/r/iastate/comments/iwpgg6/food_shortages_at_dining_centers/g6bex51/

7462,Comment,"Jeez.  COVID time is a thing.  :/

Thanks for asking.  TBH, I have good days and bad days.  I moved out here... huh... three years ago this week, actually, and I didn't really establish any social connections in Iowa before COVID hit.  So the social isolation of which /u/rotanocaB speaks?  Oh, yeah, it is a thing.  During the pandemic, I neglected a lot of the pursuits that used to bring me joy, and now I'm finding that it takes deliberate effort to get my ass out from behind my keyboard and actually go out and *do something*.  And I can still go to some pretty dark places if I spend too much time alone reviewing stuff from early 2020.

But now that it looks like we may be out from under the shadow, I'm making small steps toward reassembling myself into something that looks like a functional adult under cursory inspection.  Emergen_Wife and I got out to see Alton Brown's show at Stephens last night, which was the first live event of *any* type that we've attended since our move.  I'm heading back to Kentucky for friend and family visits soon.  And I recently went up to Minneapolis to renew my wilderness first aid certification as a prep course for an upcoming wilderness first responder class, which has been a goal for years.

So I guess rebuilding a life is a process, and it requires work.  I'm a bullet journal user, and when I set up the first page of my '22 journal, I scrawled this on it:

>Bujo is about intentionality and I had no intentions in 2021.  2022 needs to be a more deliberate year - both in choosing to do things and in choosing which things to not do.

> - Does it matter?

> - Is it important?

> - What else am I giving up for it?

The first obstacle is that the University does not want to work with us. They have their own ideas about what to do, and unfortunately they are not in line with scientific realities about the urgency of transitioning to fossil-free energy.

The second obstacle is that we are unfortunately only students. We have tried to offer ourselves to work with professors and the administration to develop clean energy plans. Unfortunately, because the University is unwilling to put any administrative force behind such an initiative, when we have tried we have basically ended up swimming by ourselves and have been unable to have success. The reality is that a project as big as this needs the university to put its full force behind it.

That is why we are switching tacks to going directly to the Board of Regents to ask for an in-depth analysis of clean energy options and opportunities on campus.

7499,Post,"This one's been on my mind for a while.  Less operations today; more reflection.
 
Every culture has its own folklore.  Emergency services are no exception.  Among the closely-held beliefs of those who work the streets and the emergency rooms is the forbidden word.  It's five letters long.  It starts with ""Q.""  If you use it, the condition it describes will cease.
 
I've seen it happen.  The first time was years ago, on a third-shift ride-along with Lexington-Fayette PD.  An officer who really should have known better said the ""Q"" word in roll call.  That shift saw *nine* Signal 7 (officer needs assistance) calls.  I learned what it was like to do 85mph down UK's equivalent of Osborne.  Shortly thereafter, I learned that pepper spray isn't entirely directional.
 
Last fall, someone said it in the emergency operations center a few hours before kickoff of the ISU-UofI game.  We all know how *that* day went.
 
So it is with some trepidation that I consider using the ""Q"" word to describe campus these days.
 
Campus isn't closed, exactly.  It isn't shut down.  But it can feel that way.  Less so, now that the weather is softening and the days are sliding toward the solstice.  But still... in the mornings, I cross Sheldon where West becomes Union, and it's deserted except for CyRide (thank you, drivers and dispatchers, for standing your posts through this).  The morning sun is shining through an empty skywalk between State Gym and Beyer.  I can get across campus to the EOC without seeing another person.

From the EOC, it's easy to lose sight of this.  We're on the edge of campus with no windows.  As we've moved from urgent decision-making and action to sustained coordination and planning, our work has developed a rhythm of its own.  Executive call at 0800, release the day's incident action plan by 0845, workgroup leader calls at 0900 and 1530, get the day's SITREP to the executives by 1700, other coordination and status updates in between all of that.  The status reports and data dumps make it easy to abstract what's happening - and what isn't.
 
But when I can, I get out of the EOC at lunch to walk and see sunlight, and the sidewalks are empty.  A couple of weeks ago, I stood in the middle of Osborne at Lagomarcino just because I could - it was completely devoid of traffic.  There is a slightly unreal quality to the emptiness (and the inaccessibility of the buildings), as if I'm in a glitched level of a game where the scenery has loaded but the NPCs haven't.
 
And yet... campus *isn't* empty.  We still have about 300 students in the residence halls and another 2,500 or so in the apartments.  Close to a thousand employees are still working on campus, doing the critical hands-on work that can't be done remotely.  We could draw that down further if we absolutely had to, if Governor Reynolds issued a more stringent stay-at-home order, but doing so would have its own consequences.  Right now, we're where we need to be for the current public health imperatives.
 
On a day like this, our normal daytime population would be over 40,000.
 
Campus is... the word I cannot say, even here... and it shouldn't be.  The silence is unnatural.  This *isn't right*.

In time, we'll figure out what normal looks like after COVID-19.  But this is the part where we do all the work to get there, and it kinda sucks.",6,32,0.97,g6xgbq,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/g6xgbq/dispatches_from_the_eoc_the_q_word/

The next year, he went 8-5, the most successful season for the program since 2000, when Iowa State went 9-3 and won the program‚Äôs first ever bowl game. In year three, Matt Campbell matched his 8-5 record the previous year, giving Iowa State its first back to back winning seasons since 2004-2005. In year four, Iowa State went 7-5, marking three consecutive winning seasons, a feat that has not been accomplished by Iowa State since 1976-1978. In year five, he not only matched the most successful season since we joined a conference, but also won the school‚Äôs first ever New Year‚Äôs Six bowl game in our first appearance in such a game, but had us within a score of winning the Big XII, which would be our first conference championship since the founding of the Big 6, the precursor of the modern Big XII. Not only that, but yet another winning season meant four seasons in a row with a winning record, something not done by Iowa State since 1923-1927. And by achieving a 7-5 record again this season, he has five consecutive winning seasons, yet again matching the 1923-1927 stretch of winning seasons.",6,73,0.97,r5cb9u,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/r5cb9u/putting_some_context_behind_matt_campbells/

For example, if you want to see the menu at Windows for dinner, type !windows dinner. You can also type !help for the commands.

Currently, only Windows, UDCC, and Seasons are implemented. I don't know if anyone wants other dining centers, but comment if you want others included.

Also, !tendies dinner and !tendies lunch tell you where tenders are, if any.

7538,Post,"## What Happened?
Your friendly /r/iastate mods have seen an influx of interest in this subreddit due to the popularity of the iastate_snaps snapchat account.  We recently removed a link and we wanted to be up front and clear about how we moderate this subreddit.

We have no problem with the talk surrounding the iastate_snaps account itself or many of the accounts that have sprung up as a result of the original account being closed.  Despite the fact that it isn't family friendly, it is a part of the college and the Iowa State experience. The /r/iastate mods don't want to stifle the conversation that students and alumni are having. 

## Regarding Not Safe for Work (NSFW) Content
NSFW content is allowed on /r/iastate, but it is not a place to post nude photographs of people that simply attend ISU.

With that said, the link that we removed consisted of, simply, porn. For anyone who has seen what the iastate_snaps account posts, it contains many images that show nudity and drug use. The album posted was some of the images of nude girls that had been posted to iastate_snaps.

We see a couple major problems with links like the one that was removed:

1. The content was purely of a sexual nature with the obvious intent to arouse. This subreddit is not the place for such content.
2. There is no way for us to know the age of the people in the photos. Many college students are under eighteen years of age. If there is anything posted that could even be remotely considered underage pornography, it will be removed.

## Summary
/r/iastate is not a subreddit for pornographic content.

If what you're posting is obviously NSFW, it should be marked as such.

/r/iastate is the best collegiate subreddit in Iowa, and the mods all enjoy the community. We want to be clear in our moderation and up front about the links we remove. If you have any questions, feel free to message the moderators and/or discuss here.",14,35,0.8,2kp4cf,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/2kp4cf/notice_links_to_porn_will_be_removed/

7550,Comment,"I'm sorry, but this use of prison labor seems really wrong to me. Although I get wanting to reduce costs for ISU and wanting to allow prisoners the chance to learn skills, I think it is morally wrong to pay people $.50-$.60/hr for work that would be much more expensive for a free person. To me, this provides an incentive for the expansion of the prison industry - if public institutions become dependent on this cheap labor, they might become allies of the prison industry when it comes to lobbying in the State House. I may be wrong, but [this article](https://www.iowastatedaily.com/news/inmates-install-dorm-furniture/article_f0632d0c-3ac4-11e5-b600-f7676951322b.html) makes it sound like most of the ""payment"" to the inmates consists of fresh air and skills to learn, and that most of the money goes to the maintenance of the prisons, which will also provide incentive to maintain the prison system as it is. Also, fresh air and skills to learn should be provided for all prisoners, not just a select few.

In my view, prisons are an antiquated and often harmful way of dealing with poverty and mental health issues, plus a healthy dose of racism in sentencing and policing. I don't remember who said it, but I remember hearing a quote along the lines of, ""Story County's biggest mental health facility is the county jail."" We should invest in mental health and anti-poverty initiatives, not in depriving people of basic rights until they beg to work for spare change. The fact that the prison-industrial complex continues to grow indicates that our institutions have become too comfortable with the cheap labor that mass incarceration provides them.",1,2,,h16lu8,t1_fump6ir,/r/iastate/comments/h16lu8/til_iowa_state_uses_prison_labor_for_dorm/fumqia9/

Your dorm likely won‚Äôt provide food on days it is super cold/snowy and you‚Äôll have to go out. I would expect maybe a couple events a month in your dorm where you could get free food if you show up. My friends and I have gotten whole boxes of pizza showing up to events where very little people came. 

I think most people on the gold plan get by just fine. If you‚Äôre super worried about not having enough food, you could get the cardinal plan.

7559,Post,"I was skeptical at first yet it exceeded my expectations. Shoutout all the homies at Seasons who worked their asses off. 

Presentation: I was pleasantly surprised when I saw my spread of wonderful Thanksgiving classics. Turkey - decent portion size, lean and carved right in front of you at Wood Grill. Carrots - seasoned well but lacking some major roasting. Yukon mashed potatoes - basic. Gravy - wasn‚Äôt very promising. Cranberry Relish - cute little portion size, typical. Pumpkin pie - perfect amount of whipped cream, looked great! Cornbread ‚Äùdressing‚Äú - It‚Äòs called stuffing but ok...looked unreasonably moist. Powermilk - ok I‚Äòm just messing around. 

Flavor & Texture: This is obviously the most important category. I was both satisfied and disappointed. Let‚Äôs start with some sides. Cranberry Relish - good flavor but you know it comes from a can. Carrots - disappointing, very soft and sweet yet cold and flavorless. Cornbread dressing - So good. I actually really enjoyed the classic stuffing flavor and texture was just right! Now for the bulk of the meal...Yukon mashed potatoes - quite natural taste, barely any seasoning but that‚Äôs what gravy is for. Gravy - tasteful, warm, scrumptious. Turkey - lean and tasty, quite dry but then again gravy. Pumpkin pie - delicious, and accompanied my meal perfectly. 

I can honestly say I was fulfilled with this meal. It really shocked me how well Seasons and presumably the other dining halls did with this. As I walked past the overflowing dish line, praying for my poor coworkers, I reflected on my meal and smiled a little with a sense of nostalgia and happiness that I got to have a somewhat normal Thanksgiving.

Most people can't function well with just 1 meal per day. I was perfectly fine with eating there twice per day.

I have one ISU meal per day, but that's because I have a kitchen in my apartment to make my other meals.

I'd actually recommend not getting any Dining Dollars unless you have to as part of a meal plan, or just have no other way to carry change. The snack prices are pretty inflated anyways at the ISU stores. You'd be better off just buying snacks from Walmart/HyVee. A monster energy drink is 2.00 at Hyvee for instance, and 2.50 at ISU.",1,3,,4csd5v,t1_d1l3nli,/r/iastate/comments/4csd5v/how_are_foods_from_isu_dining_hall/d1l6kdr/

I feel like every turn every step I take it's been a struggle, the fafsa won't consider me as a independent no matter how much reent I pay or anything, so in turn I have to use my mom's Financials, whatever I got just enough to be able to cover tuition, well I think living on campus would be easier for me, my mental health and all around, but it's 10K and that's not something that I can just drop, I don't have the money or the saving to even begin to cover that. So I've applied for loans scholarships everything I keep getting denied my mom keeps getting denied no one will cosign for me, and I feel like I'm just getting fucked, even at my community college they told me my mom makes to much and she can help me well 1 my mom is a single income household 2 she makes just enough to pay bills and 3 my mom doesn't make 150K a year she makes barely above 70K. It's a lot but not enough to even help em pay for school l, I can't drive to ISU because the town I live in is almost an hour and a half away and driving that far everyday just is ridiculous, and I just feel like I'm being screwed over in every way I don't know what to do how to go about it or anything, If you have any ideas please let me know

7595,Post,"Hello, Cyclones! (Especially first-years and new transfer students).

First of all, welcome (back?) to Iowa State University! I'm sure the University is glad to have you here, and I'm happy you're here too.

I think one of the most beneficial things as a new student is to actually **know** what resources and services Iowa State has to offer to its students. Most of these are free, but a couple have **slight** costs (I'll try to label these).

Let me follow up with this: *This post is* ***not*** *an exhaustive list of resources and services, but I think they tend to be the most helpful for new students*. That being said, there are **tons** of resources that won't be covered in this post. Many of them are available here: [https://cyclonesupport.iastate.edu/support-resources](https://cyclonesupport.iastate.edu/support-resources)

Also a disclaimer: Because I don't want to get sued or something, I should say that this post is **not** sponsored or approved by Iowa State, and while I went to great effort to ensure the information is correct, it could be incorrect. It also is not medical or legal advice.

A VM is basically program that lets you spin up whatever environment you need. So even if there's a program that only works on Windows and you have a Mac you would just have a windows VM on your Mac and you'd be fine. Thats why it doesn't matter which os you use and you should just use what you're comfortable with.

I think you would have a tougher time using an os you're not comfortable with than any trouble you might run into installing a program.

1. Never walk across the zodiac at the Memorial Union. You will flunk your next test. Supposedly there is an opportunity for remediation by throwing some coins in the fountain, but I would not chance it.
2. Kissing virgins under the campanile at midnight will cause the campanile to throw a brick. Do your part to save the campanile.
3. Go to class.
4. Talk to the professors and instructors.
5. Learn to study. Drinking is not a good substitute for studying. Neither is staying up all night playing video games. And we can't even talk about smoking the reefer since that whole tee-shirt thing.
6. Take a shower, using soap, on a frequent basis. Use deodorant. Thank you.
7. Be careful in traffic. Be extra careful when you are driving, or when you are walking near traffic. The herd gets thinned now and then. Don't be that person.
8. Move to the back of the bus! Goodness, folks- there are other folks who would like to get on this bus also. If you are wearing a backpack that is big enough to smuggle a small keg of beer, put it on the floor so that you don't block the entire aisle! Also, please review request #6.
9. Thank the bus drivers when you get off the bus. It is rumored that people have disappeared in the middle of the night for violating this tradition.

We are all on this campus together. You are paying a lot of money and making a serious time investment studying at Iowa State. Your primary job is to get an education which will lead you to a fulfilling and rewarding career. Working for the man will be your true reward. It will be all sunshine and rainbows!

If she‚Äôs trying to get a single somewhere else, well, I won‚Äôt sugar coat it. That would be very difficult. Should there be a dining hall at Wilson/Wallace? Yes. I mean, those dorms hopefully just won‚Äôt exist in the future, but students should have access to a close dining hall. Walking/taking 25 gold north to the dining halls will require some planning. 

I worked most nights of the week and lived in Friley. I walked every night from the towers parking lot. For me, it wasn‚Äôt terrible and I enjoyed the walk, but you definitely have to be prepared for the weather conditions.

7635,Comment,"A Guy did this to me around this last Christmas time, I was in target looking at routers, and a guy asks if I like gaming stuff cuz he wanted advice for a gift for his brother.

Which I assume is the scheme. But I don‚Äôt care because it‚Äôs covid and conversation in person is therefore a rarity. He asks if I have Facebook because he and his gf had just moved to ames and were looking for friends. I don‚Äôt have Facebook, it‚Äôs a waste of time, and I don‚Äôt need to know how much my family loves being conservative and hate anything left of moderate.

7661,Post,"Hello!

As you're all pretty much aware, Iowa State's Spring Break starts this weekend, 3/14-3/22. As you're probably also aware, Iowa State will be moving to Online classes during the two weeks after spring break. Both of these events will impact CyRide's service levels. Additionally, as COVID-19 continues to spread, CyRide has increased measures to disinfect the buses and building area.

* **

**Spring Break:**


Beginning Saturday, 3/14 until Sunday, 3/22, CyRide will be operating a break schedule for Spring Break. Moonlight Express will **not** operate the weekend of 3/13 or 3/20.


Routes that *will not run over* Spring Break:

* #11 Cherry
* #12 Lilac
* #21 Cardinal

Routes that will be *heavily reduced* over spring break:

* #9 Plum
* #23 Orange
* #25 Gold (route also changes)

Route that *changes* over spring break:

* #25 Gold [(Gold route ISU Break Days)](https://www.cyride.com/Home/ShowDocument?id=9437)

If you still use a paper schedule, the shaded lines for the trips do not operate. Additionally, please keep in mind that MyState sometimes has trouble keeping up with our break schedules sometimes. CyRide is not officially affiliated with MyState and has no control over whether the information is correct, or how soon errors get corrected. The best way to receive an accurate time is to utilize the printed schedule information, or give us a call at 515-292-1100.

You can view CyRide's break schedule [here.](https://www.cyride.com/schedules/school-year-schedule/break-schedules)

* **

**The two weeks after Spring Break (3/23 - 4/3):**

~~I just got officially informed yesterday that service will **not** be significantly impacted at this time, with one exception being a modification to Orange route. Please keep in mind that this decision is **subject to change** at any time dependent on load counts.~~

~~CyRide will run what is essentially a normal schedule, with the only modifications being that Orange will run a break schedule, and there will be no extra buses on any trips. Everything else will operate normally and at it's regular school year frequency. Additionally, as of right now, Moonlight will operate normally during the two weeks after Spring Break.~~

Again, please keep in mind that the above is subject to change contingent on ridership. We may start pulling back  service if we cannot justify the bus being out. **Additionally, if classes get moved to online for the remainder of the semester there may be some major modifications implemented.** We're trying to maintain a healthy balance of providing top quality service while also keeping taxpayers and student's dollars in mind. 

Stay up to date with our alerts at www.cyride.com and go to ""Rider alerts.""

* **

**Coronavirus (COVID-19) measures:**

Our first priority at Cyride is safety. As soon as Coronavirus moved into the US, Cyride immediately began to upgrade cleaning protocols and frequency.

Our CyRide laneworking crews are now disinfecting every bus using electric backpack sprayers containing [EcoLab FaciliPro](https://www.gofacilipro.com/). These sprayers also apply a static charge to bring the applied disinfectant to the entire surface. Because it's an electric sprayer, all areas of the bus are decontaminated including seats, pull cords, buttons, windows, doors, and the driver area. Each bus is disinfected daily. Additionally, drivers are encouraged to utilize provided hand sanitizer.

If you're interested, a video of the decontamination process is available on CyRide's facebook page. Simply do a search for CyRide on Facebook and you should be able to find it.

* **

If anyone has any questions about the above, feel free to leave a comment or send me a PM. Hope you all enjoy your three weeks of Spring Break!",8,71,0.96,fhl4b8,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/fhl4b8/cyride_megaupdate_spring_break_service_during_the/

7703,Post,"I am [Steve Butler](http://stevebutler.org) and am serving as the calculus coordinator this semester. Since about 10% of the students in any given semester are in a calculus class, I want to make sure that we start the semester understanding what is happening, and with some confidence in our ability to succeed.

The Canvas course shells for Math 165 (Basic calculus), Math 166 (Advanced calculus), and Math 265 (Multivariable calculus) should now be visible and ready to explore. There is a lot of information about how the course will run in Canvas and I encourage anyone in the class to take some time to get familiar with what is happening.

A few key points:

* The entire course, including quizzes and exams, is all online and there is no requirement to ever physically be somewhere.
* The course is set up to be highly flexible, for example the quizzes and exams do not have set times that they must be taken, but instead significant windows in which you can take them. You will be able to find a way to make it work with your schedule, regardless of where you are taking the course from.
* You can now access the online homework system. Before you do that you will need an online access code (which you can purchase; you do NOT have to purchase the physical copy of the book, the code can be purchased separately, and once you are into the homework system then you can get access to an electronic copy of the book). ***Most important thing: There is no course code for the homework. Instead once you go into the homework through Canvas it will automatically link you to the correct course.*** The first homework is already turned on, so you can try it out now if you want.

A significant amount of content for the course will be made publicly available on [http://calc1.org](http://calc1.org), [http://calc2.org](http://calc2.org), and [http://calc3.org](http://calc3.org); you can share this with your family so that they can also learn calculus along with you.

I am here to answer any questions you might have about calculus (or anything else you might want to know). Start asking away. (Note, I will keep checking in from time to time over the next few days so keep the questions coming.)",97,148,0.99,i6qqq0,,https://www.reddit.com/r/iastate/comments/i6qqq0/ama_with_the_calculus_coordinator_steve_butler/

Conversations is a get and go place and will have wraps, but I have never had them. I remember them also having pizza a few nights. 

Your dorm likely won‚Äôt provide food on days it is super cold/snowy and you‚Äôll have to go out. I would expect maybe a couple events a month in your dorm where you could get free food if you show up. My friends and I have gotten whole boxes of pizza showing up to events where very little people came. 

I think most people on the gold plan get by just fine. If you‚Äôre super worried about not having enough food, you could get the cardinal plan. It‚Äôs $150 more a semester but you will have unlimited meal swipes. You can go into a dining hall at any time they are open and grab a small snack and leave.

7725,Post,"""**Collegiate Recovery Community (CRC)** is a support-based and  student-focused program to provide and connect students in recovery or seeking recovery from issues such as substance use, gambling, gaming,  and more to the necessary services, resources, and opportunities to help  them thrive at ISU.""

CRC is a resource through the Student Wellness department and is here to support students at their desired need for issues related to addiction. This is not a 12 step program or formal/medical counseling, but is designed to be a more casual and approachable community with members our age that can help connect you to those resources should you desire to. This community is also open to members of the community who are not struggling with addiction but for whom addiction has impacted them.

**We currently have:**

**ROOTLESS** meetings weekly, where students casually talk to and support each other on topics of life and addiction. Every other week we have been doing some planned activities such as board games, painting, hiking. If there is interest for other activities, there is a good chance we'll do it.

**SMART Recovery**¬Æ is a 4-point science-based recovery program support  group facilitated by a trained peer mentor where participants learn self-empowering skills and support each  other in recovery.¬†This is a somewhat more formal resource to help students develop the necessary social support and skills to  maintain sobriety or to achieve sobriety from substance use disorder or process addiction.

**Wellness Coaching** includes one on one conversations with Collegiate  Recovery Community graduate student staff.  These are strength based,  peer led conversations where the student and CRC graduate staff member discuss goals and strategies that the student wants to focus on for the  year.

More information can be found on the CRC website ([http://www.studentwellness.iastate.edu/collegiate-recovery-community/](https://www.studentwellness.iastate.edu/collegiate-recovery-community/))

As a student member of the community, I'm happy to answer any questions I can about the community in the comments. Feel free to also reach out to [collegiaterecovery@iastate.edu¬†](mailto:collegiaterecovery@iastate.edu) for questions or concerns as well.

We also have a fundraiser active right now so if this is an issue close to you and you are able, please consider donating. ([http://fundisu.foundation.iastate.edu/project/19807](https://fundisu.foundation.iastate.edu/project/19807))

7751,Post,"Freshman here. As per the DOR, we do not need to empty out our rooms during winter, so I'd assume there are no additional room charges for staying on during the winter break.

I guess that the campus empties out and it is pretty lonely and bleak during the winter break. For folks who do stay back, how do you get to dining halls in the snow, if at all they stay open. If not, do we just have to grab a bite at Convos? where else can we get a bite on campus? Do we just use our dining dollars?

Also, what do you do to stay sane when the campus empties out? Not that the campus is hopping currently.

* The sub station:  If you get whole wheat and load up on the vegetables (guac, spinach, etc) it can be healthy.

* Man Salads:  Get a salad but load it up with stuff like meat, sunflower seeds, olive oil, and lots of eggs.

7783,Post,"Given the uncertainty of the virus and how I perform online full time, I have decided to take the semester off. Now I have some decisions ahead of me:

1. According to the office of financial aid, if I‚Äôd take the semester off, my loan deferment period would end in late November, so I‚Äôd have to start repaying my loans until I re-enroll. However, deferment would refresh as soon as I resume a degree-seeking status. The only other options I have to stop the loans are to have at least 6 credit hours or find an internship/co-op that has academic credit. I have a general idea as to how I find one, but the thing I‚Äôm worried about is the amount of companies cancelling these opportunities. How does an internship/co-op contribute to academic credit?

2. Otherwise, I could take 6 credit hours through ISU. Unfortunately I cannot take these through a junior college, as the loan deferment period wouldn‚Äôt refresh. If I take credits through ISU, how would I be able to get rid of my housing/dining contracts so I can just learn from home? I feel that the cost outweighs the benefits of going as opposed to staying. 

If anyone has any ideas for me, they‚Äôd be greatly appreciated.

7824,Comment,"It is common in many universities for math and statistics to be in separate departments. I suspect there might be some historical reasons for this at Iowa State. Historically, Iowa State has a very strong statistics program and it grew out of the need to handle massive amounts of agricultural data; on the other hand the math program often serves the engineering program in helping teach calculus. So in some sense the two departments are servicing different programs, so it is not unusual to have it split.

On a side note, statistics pays better. This is a reflection of the idea that there are more options for people to go into industrial positions dealing with statistics and so they have to have higher pay to woo the better statisticians into academia.

I actually would not make a formidable bouncer, my personality is anti-menacing. Once you hear me say ""hello"" you know that you have nothing to fear from me. When I was in high school, I was recruited to play on the football team (it was a short process wherein a player from the team said ""Butler, you should be on the team"" and I said ""OK""), so I joined the team as the largest player physically but in the two years I played, they did not think about having me be on defense for one second. They knew that in my heart I could not go out seeking to harm anyone.

If you're looking for other board-gamers at iastate, check out the Guild of Wargamers and Roleplayers.

I think it's Black Engineering this year? We usually have a turnout of about 20+ on Monday, and 10-15 Saturday.

There's also board games Sunday nights at 5 or 6 or something at Mayhem.  Usually around 10-15 people, and a pretty large variety of games between everyone.

I also have a friend in the ISU mafia club, which he says dabbles in board games Wednesdays, (in Carver somewhere, I think).

I will require CyRide to play Vengabus ""We like to Party!"" and it will keep getting progressively louder until people move to the back of the bus to make room for onboarding students.

I will push student Government to erect a statue of Steve Butler. Steve Butler is the heart and soul of the ISU math department and his dedication to all of the calculus student has helped students get through their tougher classes. We can not thank Steve enough, a statue in front of Carver would be the least to thank him.

The computers on the 2nd floor of Hoover hall have been removed since Covid. I would like to bring the computers back to hoover and other computer labs on campus.

There need to be emphasis on better logistics and financial planning at ISU dining. The rest of the finances going to remodeling the dining centers should  be diverted to the current understaffing issue and raising ISU dining wages.

There is a lot of resources on campus that undergraduates have not made use of, the university needs to do a better job of advertising programs such as SI, Make to innovate, and research opportunities.

The Okta Verification has been a pain and a half for students to deal with.  I would love to have the ability for the university to distribute Yubi keys through the library rental system to students.

I'm willing to bet that it's similar to the ""Plain view"" exception to the 4th amendment - if an officer spots marijuana plants in your backyard, he can seize them and arrest you for it; but one of the requirements is that the police officer has to be somewhere he is legally allowed to be when he sees it. So the officer can't trespass on your property without a warrant, see the plants, and then arrest you.

I can't be certain, but spotting the bong in a situation like that probably isn't allowed to be used as probable cause for obtaining a search warrant. 

EDIT: As explained by a much smarter man than I below, seeing a bong IS grounds for getting a search warrant - the legality of the officer's presence at the time would change whether or not anything found during that search would be court admissible.

7962,Comment,"Great question.  Unfortunately I am not the most insightful person as I have always been in academia and so I have a very academia focused mindset.  And complicating matters there are very few jobs out there with the title ""Mathematician"".   However there is good news.

First, while there are not many jobs out there specifically labeled mathematician, having a mathematics degree is a sign to employers that you have something which most people don't.  Namely, you have the ability to think and to learn.  Given the rate at which things are changing these are two critical skills to have.

Second, there are more jobs opening up to mathematicians.  The largest employers of mathematicians are the government (the NSA is the single one largest employer) but you will find them in many areas.  Also wall street is very interested in mathematicians as they have been able to find hidden patterns to help detect and exploit market weaknesses (this is why there are several mathematicians who are worth an amazing amount of money out there, e.g., Jim Simons).

If you reach out to Dawn Walker she has more insight on careers (I think she even runs a class on careers for mathematics or something to that effect).

One piece of advise I give to everyone, is if you want to go into industry, being a mathematician is fine, but you also need to know (1) how to program and (2) how to understand numbers.  This doesn't mean you have to know everything, basic Python programming and basic statistics can get you far.  But most companies that hire mathematicians get them to work on doing things which involve computation and modeling and programming and statistics are key for these.

The first time I tried Powermilk, and I was able scale the Campanile, take a Calc III exam remotely and grab a goose as it flew by, all before jumping down in front of a group of touring students. The man leading the group slowly turned, gave a little chuckle, and said ""That's a lot of power!"" I looked up past his bushy beard and saw that it was Steve Butler himself! He instantly gave me an A in not only Calc III, but in all the previous Calculus classes I had ever taken. Feeling powerful, I let go of the goose and galloped back to Friley Windows for another sip.

Dining dollars are also useful late at night where dining hall hours are limited. And the dude is living in Friley.

Eating twice a day at the dining center 3 days a week is plenty imo. Weekends alone are unstructured enough to make it make sense. If you go home for a weekend, that's 10 meals for 5 weekdays.

8048,Post,"Kind of a rant, but I feel like the dining subscription plans here have taken a nosedive in value, especially this last year. 

The $9 flex meals just seem to be not worth it in any way. If you get a meal worth $8.50 with a flex meal, you'd think the extra $0.50 would transfer to your dining dollars account, right? Nope, 'the money goes away'. That is what the ISU dining site states verbatim. 

https://www.dining.iastate.edu/meal-plans/flex-meals-dining-dollars-explained/

Well, at least now you can get more food variety and get two main courses if you want now, right? Wrong, most of the prices in the cafes don't allow for two mains, because they're typically priced above $4.50, with maybe a couple exceptions (You aren‚Äôt getting two godfathers mini pizzas). Drinks are also calculated into the cost which means getting a main and two larger sides with a drink is now nigh impossible. 

The WORST part is pricing information is not listed on their website for any of the cafes. Why???? Now I need to do mental math every time I want to get a meal bundle. Didn‚Äôt know I should‚Äôve brought a calculator with me to the caf√©.  

What was wrong with the simple two sides and a main with drink equals one swipe? Heck, three years ago you were able to get three sides with a main and a drink and it was glorious. 

Why not just purchase my meal plan‚Äôs total cost in dining dollars and only use dining dollars for all food purchases? Bulk purchasing dining dollars gives a discount, you can use them at panda express + caribou etc., and the money doesn‚Äôt ‚Äògo away‚Äô. 

Just seems like a really flawed system to me. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm missing some key vital info here that might support why they went this way. 

What do you guys think?

8065,Post,"Hi everyone,

I'm your resident bird person! I've been attempting to record the locations of where birds have been hitting windows on campus, along with identifying the species/age/sex of the birds and potentially donating them to the university so they can be used for educational purposes (note: this requires a special permit. It's against the law to keep parts of migratory birds).

**If you find a dead bird on campus, please send me a PM that includes the location (building, which side of the building), and if you can, a close-up photo.**

COVID has made my collection process a lot more difficult, so I can't always get to the birds to get a photo myself. If you give me a photo and location, I can at least record it on an online database (which can be used to inform decisions about bird-safe design at the campus and potentially municipal level).

This information can be really important. Many things threaten bird populations, like habitat degradation, insecticides, and outdoor cats, and window collisions are no exception. We usually see a large increase of window collisions during migration, which happens from March-May and again August-October. The fall migration is usually especially fatal for populations, because it's directly after the breeding season, and young birds are very susceptible to flying into glass. The City of Ames recently announced that we are the first town in Story County to be ""bird friendly,"" which is a wonderful step for conservation, but I do feel that the city and the ISU campus can be doing more to prevent window collisions (solutions do exist!).

Thanks for your time, everyone!

u/BlankeTheBard (she/her)

Edit: We're supposed to have millions upon millions of birds migrating over the state tonight. I'll probably be out tomorrow morning to see what the damages are.

Edit: I walked around the Design building, SIC, Parks, Bessey, and the Sukup Atrium this morning. I found three deceased Ovenbirds (a very cute species of warbler), and two alive but stunned birds (Nashville Warbler and Common Yellowthroat). I moved those two off the sidewalk and into some bushes. I do hope they recovered safely!

Edit: I'm honestly blown away by the number of reports I've been getting from y'all over reddit. I really appreciate it. I understand that the messaging feature on here doesn't have an 'attach photo' option. You'll either need to upload photos to imgur, or I can give you my contact information so you can send it another way.

*The Martian* -- He plays a character that grows a scraggly beard, and my beard is definitely scraggly.

*Bourne Identity* -- He plays a character that works for a top secret government organization, and I have no comment.

8116,Comment,"The question here is, is the food good, so I'm guessing the OP doesn't care how much it costs. Most people are perfectly fine eating there 2-3 times per day. The reason the 3 meals per day meme exists is because it's probably the ideal for health.

Realistically, if you factor in the time you save and the quality of the food, the ISU dining is not that expensive.

You do bring up the good point that dining dollars are better than CyCash, because you get a reduction when you buy them in bulk, and meals are  reduced when you use Dining Dollars. However, dining dollars are meant to buy snacks and guest meals, not your own meals in large numbers; so in most cases they will cost more per meal. Meals are $6-9 when you use your meal plan, and with dining dollars I'm guessing it's 9-10.

>Dining dollars are also useful late at night where dining hall hours are limited.

The C Store, etc. accept meal plans fairly late, so that's not true.

> Eating twice a day at the dining center 3 days a week is plenty imo.

I think eating different number of meals per day would be difficult to arrange, imho. But one meal per day is enough

>getting to Hyvee and Walmart is a real pain 

Definitely not the case, a lot of people enjoy riding the bus, or you can carpool.

>Weekends alone are unstructured enough to make it make sense.

Most people still need to eat during the weekend.

Only thing I didn't like about FPM was their bitch of a receptionist at their main office.

8158,Comment,"The main thing you are missing here is that CyCash is not managed by ISU Dining. Dining Dollars are a currency that is created and managed by ISU Dining and it‚Äôs not crazy for them to have it expire. If you get a gift card from nearly any restaurant it will have an expiration date as well. The university is pretty clear, and it even says it in that link you posted, that CyCash is intended for small purchases like laundry and snacks from the convenience store. They actually limit your account so you cannot have more than $50 of CyCash in it. Whether the items you can buy with Dining Dollars are a good value or not is up for debate, but thinking the university could switch over to just CyCash is unrealistic.

Also to all the people on here talking about how you can save money by cooking at home, of course it is. When you cook at home you don‚Äôt have to pay rent on a dining center or hire 1800 student employees to run the 20+ facilities that ISU Dining operates. By no means does the university think that it is cheaper to eat at a dining center. The purpose of a meal plan is for it to be convenient for the student, not to be the cheapest option.",0,1,,feikye,t3_feikye,/r/iastate/comments/feikye/unpopular_opinion_dining_dollars_are_a_scam_and/fjpu4fg/
